"Boss, I've brought her to you." The figure knelt at the foot of a large desk in a darkened office. An evil grin spread over the shaded face of the person occupying the chair behind it. He stuck an arm from the side of the chair and motioned for another dark, uniformed figure to come forward. "Sir!"
<p>
"Have a room prepared for the guest. She is a valuable lure; make her comfortable." The minion saluted and hustled off to do his master's bidding. With another grin, the master turned to the man before him. "Summon our leader to the conference screen at once."
<p>
With an identical salute and, "Sir!" the man rose and strode swiftly from the office, shutting the door behind him sharply. Moments later, a screen behind the chair lit up with the silhouette of a person dressed very expensively. A row of grunts standing at attention could be seen behind him, and although their faces were indistinct, there was a mixed sensation of honor and fear about them as the man spoke. "You wish to speak to me, Giovanni?"
<p>
Giovanni bowed his head. "Yes, master. I have brought you the girl you asked for. A place for her is being prepared as we speak."
<p>
"Excellent." The leader grinned maliciously. "This is all part of our plan. Although the girl is 'valuable bait', as you put it, she will be of much more use to us than simply that. Not only will she bring the Ketchum boy to us, but she is also powerful. If the boy resists, we could use her to persuade him--and beyond that, she could be a great asset to the team. If she and Ketchum were to join us, our dream of world domination of Pok&eacute;mon would become a reality."
<p>
At each mention of 'the Ketchum boy', Giovanni flinched slightly, but his leader did not notice. Once he was done listening, Giovanni bowed again. "You needn't worry, master. Ketchum will join us."
<p>
"Very well, my apprentice." With that, the leader's face disappeared from the conference screen. The room darkened again, and Giovanni turned back to the desk and rested his arms on it, a look of pure evil determination upon his face. <i>Finally</i>, he thought. <i>At last, Ash Ketchum, I will have you in my grasp...the mighty grasp of Team Rocket!</i>
