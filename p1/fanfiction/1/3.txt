A large Swellow sped across the skies of Route 120 and 121, looking down over the land like a natural radar scanner. Not finding its target, it flew back to its owner, who was sitting on a ledge along Route 120 with his face in his hands. Upon the Pok&eacute;mon's landing, though, the boy looked up, and Ash spoke. "Found anything?"
<p>
"Swell, swellow," the bird cooed, shaking its head 'no.' Ash's head sank back down and he began to weep. <i>Why May?</i> he thought. <i>What would anyone want with her?</i> He sat and tried to remember what he had seen last night; the thing that had carried May off had looked far too big to be a Pok&eacute;mon, but couldn't have been an airplane or helicopter....
<p>
He sat and thought for several minutes--then it hit him. He had figured out how May had been taken: balloon. And, now that he thought on it closely, it was a basket Ash had seen her struggling with a dark figure in. <i>But how could a hot-air balloon travel so fast...they don't have rocket eng--
<p>
Duh!</i> Ash stood up so quickly that Swellow flew back, startled. "I've got it! Swellow, get ready to use Fly; we're going on a bit of a side- journey." It took him two minutes at most to pack up his and May's things. The time didn't matter to him anyway. He dragged the bags outside and strapped them to Swellow's back (this was no problem, as Swellow had carried both him and May before many times) before climbing on himself, and Swellow took off.

Meanwhile, in a room at Rocket Headquarters south of Fuchsia City, May slowly opened her eyes, sat up, and looked around. "Whe...where am I?"
<p>
She looked around. The room was sparsely furnished: she was laying on the bed on one wall; next to it was a small table and chair. On the opposite wall was the only door, and when May spotted it, she started.
<p>
Giovanni was standing in the doorway to the room, a broad, evil grin on his face. "So," he said, "you're awake. Good; now we can get started."
<p>
"...What do you mean?" May backed up to the wall, still sitting on the bed.
<p>
"I was the one that had you brought here, because of who you are traveling with."
<p>
At this, May stood and slowly advanced towards Giovanni with an angry fire in her eyes. "What is it that you want with Ash?" she said threateningly.
<p>
The smile on Giovanni's face widened, and he snapped his fingers. A glowing pair of eyes appeared behind him, and May froze in mid-step. "The reason I want Ash is because of the power he can bring to our team." He began to circle the immobilized May, who could only follow him with her eyes. "You are here to help us achieve that. Alakazam!"
<p>
An Alakazam emerged from the shadows, wearing a metal suit and helmet, through which only its eyes were visible. The eyes began to glow brightly as it stared at May. The last thing she remembered before slipping away was, <i>Ash...no!</i> Her eyes clouded over, and she collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
<p>
"Very good. Perform the procedure on her at once." Giovanni then turned and left the room, shutting off the lights and closing the door.
<p>
Through the darkness, the only things visible were the eyes of the Alakazam.
