<i>(Pok&#233;mon/let's do it)<br>
I want to be the very best<br>
Like no one ever was<br>
To catch them is my real test<br>
To train them is my cause<br>
My whole life has led to this<br>
Time to test my skills<br>
I know I just can't miss<br>
Gonna show the world

Born to be a winner (Johto)<br>

Arm in arm we'll win the fight<br>
Gonna live our dream

This series, about the same length as Johto Journeys, begins in Goldenrod City, where Ash earns his Plain Badge from Whitney. The group then ventures to Ecruteak, where Ash learns a little more about Ho-Oh, whom he saw on his first day as a trainer, and beats Morty's powerful Ghost-type Pok&#233;mon to earn the Fog Badge. The last badge Ash earns is the Storm Badge, against the Fighting trainer Bruno while on an errand for Jasmine, Gym Leader of Olivine City, in Cianwood City. There really isn't much else to say about this season, except it has some of the best Wobbuffet episodes in the whole show so far: Power Play!, Wobbapalooza, and the classic The Wayward Wobbuffet, just to name a few. After Cianwood City, Ash, Misty, and Brock leave Cianwood for Olivine, but get a bit caught up on the way in the Whirl Islands. (Over the series, Chikorita evolves into Bayleef, and Brock's Zubat (one of the oldest Pok&#233;mon in the group) evolves into Golbat, then to Crobat.)
