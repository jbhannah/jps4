The episode begins with a really cool bit of animation: first, the battle screen of Nidorino and Gengar that appears at the start of the Pok&#233;mon Red video game appears, but near the end spirals upward into a three dimensional animation and falls away to show the shape of a stadium battle floor, then the scene brightens to reveal a huge stadium and an intense battle between Gengar and Nidorino in progress. As the battle continues, the scene again zooms out to show that the battle is on a television screen, then pans to show Ash, pulling on his gloves and getting ready for the next day, his first day as a trainer. However, his mother comes in and tells him to go to sleep, switching off the battle in favor of a program by Professor Oak about the three starter Pok&#233;mon available. During the night, Ash dreams that he's calling out each of those three, but unconsciously throws his alarm clock like a Pok&#233; Ball.
<P>
The next morning, Ash wakes to find that is already well past the time that he was supposed to be at Professor Oak's laboratory to pick up his first Pok&#233;mon. Still wearing his pajamas, he sprints to the lab, just in time to see Gary and his personal cheerleading squad taking off. Just as Ash is trying to describe how much he hates Gary, Professor Oak (who happens to be Gary's grandfather) shows up. He leads Ash inside, and to a table with three Pok&#233; Balls on it--however, all three are empty. Ash is disappointed, but the Professor pushes a button that opens a hole in the center of the table, revealing a fourth Pok&#233; Ball, containing a Pikachu. Ash thinks it's cute, but as soon as he picks it up, the Pikachu hits him with a Thundershock, sort of setting the tone for at least the rest of the episode, as far as Ash and Pikachu's relationship goes.
<P>
After getting his Pok&#233;dex and Pok&#233; Balls, Ash leaves Professor Oak's laboratory. Outside, his mother had gathered a crowd of people to see him off, and she gives him his backpack, clothes, sleeping bag, and other 'necessities' that she thinks he'll need for his journey. Once he's changed out of his pajamas, he puts Pikachu on a tether made from a clothesline and puts on rubber gloves to protect against Thundershocks, and heads up the hill leading away from Pallet Town and to Viridian City. Not very far along the road, Ash spies a Pidgey on the roadside, but Pikachu refuses to battle it, and Ash's attempts to catch it on his own fail miserably. Once he recovers from a Sand Attack he was just dealt, he finds that there are Rattata in his backpack. At this point, even his Pok&#233;dex hates him. Seeing the outline of what looks like a Pidgey, he picks up a rock and throws it in anger, but what looked like a Pidgey was a mean-tempered Spearow, who immediately begins to attack Ash and Pikachu, who stops it with a Thundershock.
<P>
Before Ash and Pikachu can leave, however, the Spearow sends a distress call to its flock in a nearby tree, and a moment later Ash and Pikachu are forced to run, both being Pecked fiercely. Pikachu is soon unable to run, having taken so much damage, and Ash has to carry it. Soon, he comes to a cliff and a waterfall; he takes a chance and dives down the waterfall, still carrying Pikachu, and is swept away by the river below, until his shirt catches on a fishhook. Misty, thinking that she caught a fish, pulls Ash and Pikachu from the water. Ash, once he regains full awareness of the situation (the Spearow are still following them and closing in fast), runs over to Misty's bike, puts Pikachu in the basket, and leaves, yelling over his shoulder, "I'm borrowing it!" and leaving Misty steamed.
<P>
A thunderstorm soon rolls in, but the Spearow don't give up. Ash dives the bike over a cliff into a field, and Pikachu goes flying, apparently knocked out. Ash tells Pikachu to get in its Pok&#233; Ball, which it had refused to do before, and stands up, telling the Spearow to attack him instead of Pikachu. The Spearow come within a yard of Ash, before Pikachu gets to its feet, leaps over Ash's shoulder, and unleashes an insanely powerful Thundershock attack, more powerful than any other attack seen by Pikachu in any episode even now. Ash, Pikachu, and the Spearow are all knocked out, and Ash and Pikachu wake up later that day to see a rainbow and a mysterious multi-tailed Pok&#233;mon flying overhead. Ash consults Dexter, but only gets "There is no data. There are still many Pok&#233;mon yet to be discovered." This sort of sets the stage for the entire show to come, and Ash, smiling, picks up Pikachu and begins to carry him toward Viridian City.
<P>
