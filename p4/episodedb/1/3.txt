This episode picks up where the last one left off: Ash, Pikachu, and Misty have encountered a Caterpie just after entering the Viridian Forest on their way to Pewter City, and Ash, having decided to capture it, is waiting to see if his Pok&#233; Ball can do the job. The ball hits Caterpie, who disappears into it in a flash of red light, and after wriggling on the ground for a moment, the Pok&#233; Ball becomes still, meaning Ash has made the first capture of his career. But even though the Caterpie is only inside the Pok&#233; Ball, Misty still refuses to go near it--unfortunately, when Ash releases Caterpie from the ball for some air, it becomes apparant that Caterpie <i>likes</i> Misty, who decides to try a different path out of the forest. In the end, though (partially because she doesn't know a way out), she ends up following Ash again. That night, Pikachu have a bit of a discussion about what Caterpie's dream is: to become a Butterfree and be able to fly.

The next morning, Misty gets a ratehr rude awakening: Caterpie, sleeping right next to her. Her scream wakes up a disgruntled Ash, but before they can get into an argument a wild Pidgeotto comes swooping past. Ash tries to attack it with Caterpie, but doesn't realize until too late that bug Pok&#233;mon aren't much good against birds. So, he tries Pikachu instead, and is much more successful, capturing his second Pok&#233;mon in two days. Misty, however, still berates him for trying to use Caterpie against a Pidgeotto, but before she can get too far Team Rocket comes in again and reveals their new mission: to capture Pikachu (unbeknownst to the fact that they will continue and be unsuccessful at this pursuit for more than three years). Koffing blinds Pikachu with a Sludge Attack, and Pidgeotto can't do much when it's trying to take on two Pok&#233;mon at once (especially with Ash's lack of experience), but Caterpie stops Ekans, Koffing, and Meowth in their tracks with its String Shot attack. Team Rocket admits defeat and runs off, giving Ash his first Pok&#233;mon battle victory. Just as Misty is about to pat Caterpie on the head, congratulate it, and possibly get rid of her fear of bugs, Caterpie throws out another String Shot, but this one isn't an attack: Caterpie is evolving into Metapod. With two new Pok&#233;mon on his belt and one win on his record, Ash runs off into the forest, with Misty (carrying Pikachu, still feeling the effects of the Sludge attack) close behind him.
