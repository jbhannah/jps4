Ash, Pikachu, and Misty finally arrive in Pewter City, and stop to rest on some rocks before continuing to the Pok&#233;mon Center. An old man, Flint, who's sitting on the ground below them, says that they're sitting on his mercendise (he sells rocks), and upon noticing that Pikachu is really worn out, offers to show them the way to the Pok&#233;mon Center. There, while waiting for his Pok&#233;mon to be healed, Ash sees a poster for the Pok&#233;mon League Regional Championships, and decides to enter. Misty tells him that to enter, he'll need to earn Gym badges from different towns, but Ash says he's up to the challenge--but Flint doesn't believe that Ash will be able to beat Brock, the Pewter City Gym Leader.

As soon as his Pok&#233;mon are healed, Ash goes to the Pewter City Gym and challenges Brock to a two-on-two match on the Pewter Gym's rocky battlefield. Ash starts with Pikachu; Brock calls out Onix. Pikachu tries to run away and send out Pidgeotto instead, but Ash makes it stay in the match. It isn't very long before Onix has Pikachu in a Bind attack, and Ash is forced to surrender. Flint meets Ash outside the Gym, and invites him back to his house to let Pikachu rest. Flint tells Ash he shouldn't worry about losing, and says that Brock could go a lot farther than being a local Gym Leader; when Ash asks why, Flint takes him past Brock's house, showing him that Brock could have gone to a regional championship if it weren't for his father leaving the family and his mother dying, leaving Brock to take care of ten younger brothers and sisters. Then, he suggests a way that Ash might be able to power up Pikachu to win the next match.

Ash and Pikachu follow Flint to the city's ferry-wheel hydroelectric plant, and suggests that Ash hook Pikachu up to the generator and turn the wheel manually, like a stair climbing machine. It takes a moment for Pikachu to get used to the surge of power, but the amount of power it can absorb is overwhelming, almost causing the generator to explode. The next morning, Ash returns to the Gym for a rematch. Ash starts with Pikachu again, and this time Brock chooses Geodude. It only takes one Thundershock to fry Geodude, but Onix still scares Pikachu, whose next attempt at a Thundershock is so haphazard that it sends bolts of electricity at Onix, the trainers, and the battlefield, and into the roof. Onix manages to Bind Pikachu (whose next attack has a decent effect), but Brock calls for Onix to stop after only moments; to quote: "There's no point in going on. I don't want to hurt your Pok&#233;mon." However, the match is not over yet. The Thundershock bolt that hit the roof started a small fire, activating the overhead sprinklers. Ash takes advantage of Onix's weakness against water and uses another attack to put Onix on the ground, but before he can call his next attack, Brock's little brothers and sisters, who had been watching from the balcony, all jump on Ash and hold him back. After thinking it over, Ash recalls Pikachu and says that winning because of the sprinklers having gone off wouldn't have proved anything, then leaves.
<p>
Brock follows Ash down the road from the Gym, though, and gives him the Boulder Badge anyway, because he won the battle and beat Brock in being kind to Pok&#233;mon; then Brock asks Ash to fulfill his dream of becoming the world's greatest Pok&#233;mon breeder for him, because he's bound to his hometown by the responsibility of caring for his siblings. Flint then reappears, and pulls off the fake beard and wig he was wearing, showing that in reality he looks almost exactly like Brock--who recognizes him as his father. Flint offers to stay home and care for the Gym and his family, to let Brock travel around the world to fulfill his dream. Brock decides to travel with Ash and Misty, and that night the trio leaves Pewter City, heading for Mt. Moon (on the way, trampling Team Rocket as they climb out of a hole that they dug for Ash, but fell into themselves at the start of the episode).
