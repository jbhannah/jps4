As Ash and Misty are hiking up Mount Moon with Brock, who is explaining the legend of the Moon Stone to them, the trio comes up on a a guy wearing a lab coat and being attacked by a flock of Zubat. Pikachu's Thundershock scares the Zubat back into their cave; after expressing his gratitude and introducing himself, Seymour takes Ash, Misty, and Brock inside the cave, and shows them that lights have been drying up the cave, causing the Pok&#233;mon to tire easily and act strange. Seymour's theory is that the people who put the lights up are looking for the Moon Stone (which he thinks is what brought Pok&#233;mon to Earth from space). Just then, a Clefairy bounces by, carrying a Moon Stone fragment. Seymour convinces Ash to let it be, but as soon as it disappears around the corner Meowth appears and traps it, and Team Rocket arrives on the scene at the same time as Ash, Misty, Brock, and Seymour. Brock and Ash stay to take on Team Rocket's Koffing and Ekans, while Seymour, Misty, and Clefairy escape.

Ash calls out Butterfree to battle, while Brock chooses a Zubat that he somehow caught while they were saving Seymour from the Zubat flock. Zubat's Supersonic confuses Team Rocket's Pok&#233;mon, and Butterfree's Whirlwind blows them out of the cave. It's just as Team Rocket has disappeared that Ash and Brock realize: "Where's Meowth!?" Meowth had followed Misty and Seymour (who were following the Clefairy) all the way to a river running down Mount Moon, and was trying to steal the Moon Stone from Clefairy, but Misty's Staryu's Water Gun inflates Meowth like a water balloon and sends him flying. Soon after, Ash and Brock catch up with Misty and Seymour, and they all decide to camp out by the river that evening. After a while, Pikachu, who had been talking with Clefairy, runs up the mountain and calls for everyone to follow.

Clefairy and Pikachu lead everyone to another cave containing the core of the Moon Stone, where the group witnesses a ceremony of the Clefairy (apparantly) praying to the Moon Stone. Team Rocket shows up again at that point, and under the cover of a Koffing Smoke Screen, steal the Moon Stone. Brock has Onix burrow underground to go after Team Rocket, while he, Ash, Misty, and Seymour chase after on foot. Team Rocket had been taking the Moon Stone down the mountain on a sled, but Onix surfaces right in their path, causing them to crash. The Clefairy follow close behind Onix, and Seymour after them. The Clefairy begin a Metronome attack, which turns into Explosion and sends Team Rocket "blasting off again." The explosion had also shattered the Moon Stone, sending some shards into the air and landing them on some of the Clefairy, which evolved into Clefable. Seymour decides to live with the Clefairy and someday travel to the stars with them in the Moon Stone. The next morning, Ash, Misty, and Brock leave on the road to Cerulean City; on the way, Ash sees a sign with a message written on it that sends him sprinting down the road. The message reads: "Gary was here/Ash is a loser!"
