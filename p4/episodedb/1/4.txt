Again, the episode begins with Ash discovering a new Pok&#233;mon--actually, Misty discovers it this time, and points it out to Ash from her hiding place behind him: a Weedle. Ash looks it up on his Pok&#233;dex, and taking into account what Misty had taught him earlier, decides to use Pidgeotto to go after it (Pikachu's taking a nap anyway). Misty, who can't stand any more bugs and has decided to try to get out of the forest on her own, is ambushed by a sword-wielding trainer in a feudal samurai outfit, who asks if she is a trainer from Pallet Town. His search unsuccessful, the samurai leaps off into the forest. Then Misty realizes what's going on: that guy is looking for Ash!
<p>
Meanwhile, Ash is just about to capture Weedle, when Samurai sneaks up behind him and challenges Ash to a battle. Ash loses his concentration, the Weedle, and his temper at the same time, and accepts the challenge. Pidgeotto (who was also asleep, and had to wake up to battle) was no match for Samurai's Pinsir, but Metapod's Harden attack rendered Pinsir's pincers useless. Samurai then sends out his next Pok&#233;mon, which is...Metapod? All that both Pok&#233;mon can do is Harden, so neither trainer has any choice but to use Harden and wait until the other trainer's Pok&#233;mon gives in. Unfortunately, the trainers last a lot less than the Pok&#233;mon; while Misty and Pikachu are taking the opportunity to sunbathe, both trainers collapse (they literally fall over stiff, still gasping orders at their Pok&#233;mon).

Team Rocket, elsewhere in the forest, is dragging around a large cardboard tank to protect them from Beedrill. Meowth, riding on top while James and Jessie drive, makes a comment about how he wishes he could help drive, "but I'm watching lookout," prompting the other two to pitch him off of the top of the tank. Back at the battle, an approaching Beedrill swarm forces Ash and Samurai's battle to end. Samurai recalls his Metapod, but before Ash can do the same, a Beedrill has swooped down and stolen it, apparantly mistaking it for a Kakuna. Ash, Misty, Pikachu, and Samurai are forced to run and hide behind a hedge, but on the other side of the hedge is a tree with a nest of Kakuna. Ash sees Metapod there, and his voice wakes up the Kakuna, who open and evolve into Beedrill, who chase everyone to Samurai's cabin.
<p>
In the cabin, Samurai berates Ash for abandoning his Metapod, and recounts how responsible the other trainers from Pallet Town that he battled with were. Ash, Pikachu, and Misty spend the night at the cabin. At sunrise the next day, Ash gets up and leaves on an attempt to rescue Metapod. Just as Ash is about to grab Metapod and run for it, he gets his head landed on by Meowth, cueing Team Rocket to begin a very loud rendition of their motto and waking up another horde of Beedrill. Ash is able to dive past the swarm and get to Metapod, but Team Rocket isn't so lucky: Weedle eat paper, and their tank looked like breakfast, so they're forced to run for it. Ash takes Metapod and runs, but a Beedrill spots him and tries to use Twin Needle, but Metapod blocks it, Beedrill's needle ripping a gash in the shell. Seconds later, beams of light stream from the gash, and a Butterfree emerges from the shell; Ash has it use Sleep Powder on the Beedrill (and Team Rocket), protecting everyone from harm. Samurai (who, with Misty and Pikachu, arrived under a Beedrill net just before the evolution) compliments Ash on how easily he was able to handle Butterfree so soon after evolution, and points him and Misty on the road to Pewter City. Meanwhile, thought, Team Rocket is still having bad luck in the forest, forced to wrap themselves in paper Kakuna costumes for camoflauge until they can escape (but they somehow make it to Pewter City in time for the next episode).
