After the events on Route 1, Ash is seen running towards the gate of Viridian City, just as the Officer Jenny posted there is warning the citizens of the iminent danger of Pok&#233;mon thieves in the area. The way Ash was carrying Pikachu and running made Jenny think that Ash was stealing the Pok&#233;mon, but once she realized it was hurt she offered him a ride to the Pok&#233;mon Center. After an exciting motorcycle ride that culminates in a jump over the front steps and through the door of the Center, Jenny explains the situation to Nurse Joy, who leads Pikachu into the intensive care unit.

In Officer Jenny's absence from her post at the city entrance, a fishhook appears and peels off a paper on a wooden sign next to the station. The fishhook is on a fishing line wielded by James and Jessie, two of the top members of the Team Rocket Pok&#233;mon criminal society. (So enters the Team Rocket we come to know and love--or hate--over the next few hundred episodes). Back in the Center, while Ash is waiting for Nurse Joy and her Chansey assistants to finish treating Pikachu, he notices a panel on the wall that looks like the Pok&#233;mon he had seen earlier that day. Just then, Professor Oak calls the center; Ash answers and mentions the mystery Pok&#233;mon to him, but the Professor says it's impossible that that was what he had seen, that top researchers had spent years looking for that Pok&#233;mon and never finding it. Two things happen then: the Professor's pizza arrives and he hangs up, and Misty reappears, extremely steamed and carrying her now-totaled bike ("What happened to my bike? <i>You</i> happened to my bike!"). Ash tries to apologize, but Misty doesn't listen until he mentions Pikachu's condition.

Pikachu is then released from intensive care, and Ash is allowed to go into the recovery room with it. However, before they can leave the lobby, Jessie and James, flying above the Center in their Meowth-head balloon, release their two Pok&#233;mon, Koffing and Ekans, into the center. Koffing lays down a smokescreen, and Jessie, James, and Meowth appear and give their motto. Ash is thoroughly unimpressed, and Koffing and Ekans are ordered to begin attacking the Center and to search for rare Pok&#233;mon. Ash, Misty, and Nurse Joy run into the recovery room for safety and Joy begins to send Pok&#233; Balls to the Pewter City Center, but Koffing cuts the power (luckily the center had a team of Pikachu on reserve in case that happened) and blasts in through the door. A number of attempts to use the Pok&#233; Balls in the recovery room to drive away Koffing and Ekans are unsuccessful, and Misty offers to take over to give Ash a chance to get Pikachu away from there.

This he does, but he's tripped up in the lobby. Just as Pikachu and Ash are about to be finished off by Koffing and Ekans, the reserve-power Pikachu all jump onto Pikachu's stretcher and use Thundershock, holding back Team Rocket and waking up Pikachu. Ash then, at Pikachu's request, hooks him up to the generator light on Misty's bike and uses that to provide a large amount of power to finish off Team Rocket. The electricity from the next attack causes Koffing to explode, driving away the Rockets and destroying the Center. Pikachu is fully recovered, and the next day, Ash, Pikachu, and Misty (who vowed to keep traveling with Ash until he pays her back for her bike), set off for the Viridian Forest. Not very far in, Ash spies another wild Pok&#233;mon, a Caterpie; the episode ends with a still a Pok&#233; Ball in midair between him and the Caterpie, with Misty (who hates bugs) watching tensely in the background.
