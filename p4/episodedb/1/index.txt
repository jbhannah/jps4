<i>I want to be the very best<br>
Like no one ever was<br>
To catch them is my real test<br>
To train them is my cause<br>
I will travel across the land<br>
Searching far and wide<br>
For each Pok&#233;mon, to understand<br>
The power that's inside
<p>
Pok&#233;mon (gotta catch 'em all)<br>
It's you and me<br>
I know it's our destiny<br>
Pok&#233;mon<br>
Ooh, you're my best friend<br>
In a world we must defend<br>
Pok&#233;mon (gotta catch 'em all)<br>
A heart so true<br>
Our courage will pull us through<br>
You teach me and I'll teach you<br>
Pok&#233;mon<br>
Gotta catch 'em all</i>

<i>Every challenge along the way<br>
With courage I will face<br>
I will battle every day<br>
To claim my rightful place<br>
Come with me, the time is right<br>
There's no better team<br>
Arm in arm we'll win the fight<br>
It's always been our dream
<p>
Pok&#233;mon (gotta catch 'em all)<br>
It's you and me<br>
I know it's our destiny<br>
Pok&#233;mon<br>
Ooh, you're my best friend<br>
In a world we must defend<br>

Lyrics &#169;1999 John Siegler and John Loeffler
</center>
<p>
This season is the first in the long-running Pok&#233;mon anim&#233; series. Ash Ketchum, a young boy from Pallet Town, leaves with his Pikachu to travel through the Kanto region. The first of the many friends he meets is Misty (who is, as far as she says, only following him until he pays back for her bike). He quickly becomes a powerful trainer, earning badges, catching new Pok&#233;mon, preventing the bumbling Team Rocket from stealing his Pikachu, and making new frineds. He meets Brock in Pewter City and earns the Boulder Badge from him; in Cerulean City, Misty faces Ash in a match for the Cascade Badge; on his way to Cinnabar Island for his seventh Badge, the Volcano Badge, he meets Todd, the Pok&#233;mon photographer, who quickly leaves (but will meet up with Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu later on).
<p>
It takes Ash a year to earn all eight badges. Fourteen months after leaving Pallet Town, he travels to the Indigo Plateau to complete in the Pok&#233;mon League Championships. Ash meets Ritchie at the Indigo Village, the city where the trainers stay; they quickly become good friends. Through the four preliminary rounds, Ash has no trouble advancing; Ritchie does the same, beating Ash's rival, Gary Oak (grandson of Professor Samuel Oak, who gave Ash his Pok&#233;mon Trainer's Liscence) in the fourth round. In the fifth round, Ash and Ritchie are forced to battle, but Ritchie wins because Charizard refuses to battle. Ritchie is eliminated in the next round anyway. After the tournament, Ash and Ritchie each promise that they'll be much stronger next time they meet, and then part ways.
<p>
Ash returns to Pallet Town following the tournament, to find that Professor Oak has a new assignment for him: to travel to the Orange Islands on an errand to get the G/S Ball from Professor Ivy. Ash accepts, and he, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu leave right away for the Orange Islands.
