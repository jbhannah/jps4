After leaving Pallet Town again, Ash and Pikachu are on a luxury cruise ship bound for Littleroot Town in Hoenn...with Team Rocket as stowaways, of course. Team Rocket captures Pikachu while Ash and everyone else on the boat is sleeping, but Ash wakes up and alerts the capitan, and the two corner Team Rocket in the food storage compartment. One of Team Rocket's attacks ruptures the water tank and floods the ship, forcing the ship to stop in the nearest port for repairs. Team Rocket, who still has Pikachu, jumps off the boat and on the top of two freight trucks (Jessie and James on one, Meowth and Pikachu on the other), but the trucks turn in opposite directions, leaving Meowth and Pikachu stranded in an alley.

Ash, who had tried to follow Team Rocket (the capitan had said he'd wait until sundown for Ash, but would have to leave then), ends up lost until Officer Jenny finds him and offers to help recover Pikachu. Meanwhile, Pikachu and Meowth are being bothered by a Haunter in the alley, until Pikachu scares it off with a Thundershock. After watching Pikachu in action, the Ratatta, Pidgey, and Oddish that live in the alley come out to talk, and warn Pikachu and Meowth that the Haunter will be back with more of its friends. Sure enough, moments later four Haunter appear and surround Meowth and Pikachu; while the Haunter turn their attention to Meowth, Pikachu leaps up and uses another Thundershock to scare them off for good. The local Pok&#233;mon cheer and ask for Pikachu to stay with them and protect them, but Meowth says no, because Team Rocket had already claimed Pikachu (enter Pikachu face-fault).

Just then, who else would show up but Team Rocket, who, using a metal brace and an electromagnet, recapture Pikachu, then lift Meowth back into the balloon with their mechanical hand before starting to fly away. Before they can get very far, Officer Jenny's Pidgeot tears a hole in their baloon, causing them to crash land and turning off the electromagnet, releasing Pikachu. Ash is holding on to Pikachu by the time Team Rocket recoves, but they still turn the electromagnet back on and take Pikachu back again. The Haunter, sensing trouble, come back and are able to destroy the electromagnet, sending Team Rocket "blasing off again" and freeing Pikachu. Since it was already almost dark and the ship had left, Officer Jenny's Pidgeot gives Ash a ride back to the ship. The next morning, Ash is standing outside when a flock of Wingull and Pelipper fly overhead. Ash rushes back in to wake Pikachu up so it can see all of the new Pok&#233;mon, but Pikachu won't wake up, and sparks keep flying at random from its cheeks; something is obviously wrong with it....
