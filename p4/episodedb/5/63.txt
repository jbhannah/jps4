For the first time in nearly two years, Ash, Misty, and Brock have returned to Viridian City, on their way back to Pallet Town after the Silver Conference. At the Pok&#233;mon Center is where things begin to happen. Misty gets a phone call from her sisters in Cerulean City: Daisy won third prize in a beauty contest, a trip around the world, and she, Violet, and Lily are leaving--and they want Misty to return home and watch the Gym for them. Nurse Joy then presents Misty with her bike, which the Joy that had been there when Ash first began as a trainer had fixed up for her. Ash seems to think this is good, since now it'll be easier for Misty to get home, but this only sends Misty running out of the Center, just short of crying because it doesn't seem like Ash is even fazed about her having to leave (which Brock later explains to Ash back at the Center).

On the streets in Viridian City, Misty encounters three trainers, the self-titled Invincible Brothers, who challenge her to a Pok&#233;mon battle. Misty uses her Politoed to take down their first Pok&#233;mon, Hitmonchan, but then they send out two more, Hitmonlee and Hitmontop, to make it a three-on-one battle. Then, Ash and Brock show up, using Pikachu and Forretress to even the odds, but they let Misty finish the battle. Brock reasons that, "Since you have to leave, we just wanted to share this last battle with you," and Ash says he's glad that Misty's always been a good friend to him. He then points out Misty's bike, and says: "Your bike's there. You're in a hurry, aren't you?"; Misty, realizing that they both--especially Ash--are sad that she has to leave, thanks them both for traveling with her and being her friends.

For the last time--Misty with her bike--the trio walks along the path, leading to the interseciton of roads leading away from Viridian: one to Pewter City, one to Cerulean, and one to Pallet Town. Misty tells Togepi about how she first met Ash. Ash says that it definitely wasn't a coincidence that he and Misty met each other; Brock chimes in and says he agrees, and that he thinks they've all become best friends over their time together. Finally, they reach the split in the road, but before Misty leaves, Brock announces that he got an E-mail and also has to go home and run some errands. So, Misty and Brock go off on their separate ways. Ash starts to say something, but pauses, and Brock, who had come back to listen to what he was saying, tells him to go on (scaring the heck out of Ash). Misty and Brock then give Ash parting gifts: a lunchbox with rice balls and cutlery from Brock, and a handkerchief to "make it easier to carry" from Misty. Misty then rides off down the road to Cerulean City ("So, Ash Ketchum, now I finally know how you feel about me"); Brock begins walking along the road north to Pewter City, munching on a rice ball and crying ("Must be the onions...."); and Ash sprints south towards Pallet Town, carrying his gifts and not looking back, Pikachu following close behind him.

Ash arrives in Pallet Town that night; the next morning his mom tells him that Gary had just arrived home days before and would probably be at Professor Oak's laboratory. Ash goes over to the lab, but only to find that Gary had just left on another journey. Running, Ash is able to catch Gary on the road leading away from Pallet, and gives him half of the Pok&#233; Ball that they had broken before they started their first journeys, and Gary had given back to Ash after losing to him at the Silver Conference. Later that afternoon, as Ash is sitting with Pikachu in a tree outside town, he sees Ho-Oh fly out from behind some clouds, towards the Hoenn Region; that evening, he announces that he wants to start a new journey, with just Pikachu. Professor Oak gives him a new Pok&#233;dex, and Delia Ketchum gives him a new outfit and backpack for his new journey.
