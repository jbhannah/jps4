<i>Wanna take the ultimate step<br>
Have the courage to be bold<br>
To risk it all and not forget<br>
The lessons that I hold<br>
I wanna go where no one's been<br>
Far beyond the crowd<br>
To learn the way to take command<br>
Use the power that's in my hand
<p>
We all live in a Pok&#233;mon world<br>
I wanna be the greatest<br>
Master of them all<br>
We all live in a Pok&#233;mon world<br>
Put myself to the test<br>
Be better than all the rest</i>

<i>Every day along the way<br>
I will be prepared<br>
With every challenge I will gain<br>
Knowledge to be shared<br>
In my heart there's no doubt<br>
Of who I want to be<br>
Right here, standing strong<br>
And you right next to me<br>
I will risk all I can<br>
Until mine is the name<br>
Of greatest master of Pok&#233;mon
<p>
We all live in a Pok&#233;mon world<br>
I wanna be the greatest<br>
Master of them all<br>
We all live in a Pok&#233;mon world<br>
Put myself to the test<br>
Be better than all the rest</i>

Lyrics &#169;2000 John Siegler and John Loeffler
</center>
<p>
After retrieving the G/S Ball from Professor Ivy on Valencia Island (where Brock decides to stay to help at Professor Ivy's research lab), Ash and Misty learn about the Orange League, and Ash decides to enter. Soon after, Tracy Sketchit meets up with them, and they find a lost, injured Lapras who Ash takes custody of for their time in the Islands and uses to get around.
<p>
In the first part of the season, Ash and friends travel to Mikan Island, where Ash wins his first Orange League Badge from Sissy. Ash catches his Snorlax on the Grapefruit Islands, and earns his three other Badges from Danny on Navel Island (whom Misty falls for), Rudy on Trovita Island (who falls for Misty; man, some season she had!), and Luana on Kumquat Island.
<p>
After earning all four Orange League Gym Badges, Ash and crew travels to Pummelo Island to challenge the Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader, the Dragonite trainer Drake. Ash and Drake square off in a two-episode, grueling Pok&#233;mon battle; the first five rounds are Ash's at the cost of only two of his six Pok&#233;mon, but Drake's Dragonite reduces Ash's team only to Pikachu, who uses his tail to avoid a Hyper Beam and finishes off Dragonite with a point-blank Thundershock, winning Ash the new title of Supreme Gym Leader.
<p>
Ash, Misty, and Tracey return to Pallet Town to find--guess who?--Brock, working in Delia Ketchum's kitchen! Tracey decides to remain in Pallet to assist Professor Oak (to whom Ash gives the G/S ball). But only days after returning, Ash learns that Gary is already off to a new land, the Johto region. Soon, Ash, Misty, and Brock are on their way to the Johto League and another adventure.
