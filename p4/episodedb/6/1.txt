The beginning of the episode introduces May, a ten-year-old beginning Pok&#233;mon trainer who doesn't really like Pok&#233;mon that much (as an encounter she has with a Duskull indicates); she's really in it for the traveling, and is going to Littleroot Town to get her first Pok&#233;mon. The opener ends as May arrives on her bike at the cliff overlooking Littleroot Town. The scene pans to show the ocean, and the boat that Ash and Pikachu are arriving on.

Ash and Pikachu are still sailing towards Littleroot Town. As the episode opens, Ash is holding Pikachu, who is still sparking randomly, on his lap as they wait for the boat to arrive in Littleroot. When they arrive, Ash immediately goes to a payphone and calls Professor Birch's lab, only to be informed that the Professor is out doing field research. He comes to where Ash is quickly, however, in his jeep, and takes Ash and Pikachu back to his laboratory. There, he tries to relieve Pikachu of its extra electrical pressure, but the asborber explodes, and Pikachu runs out through the broken window and into the forest. Ash and Professor Birch decide to split up to search for Pikachu.

Meanwhile, May arrives at Professor Birch's lab, only to find that he's gone out, but as soon as she finds out where he is she goes to look for him. While searching for Pikachu, Professor Birch has slipped down a hill and aggrevated a trio of Poocyena, and May finds him hanging on to a tree branch. The Professor tells her to use one of the Pok&#233; Balls in his bag at the top of the hill to stop the Poochyena. May chooses Mudkip, who uses Water Gun on her before Professor Birch corrects it and has it use its attack to drive away the Poochyena. After Professor Birch climbs back up to the top of the hill, he and May see a large lightning bolt from Pikachu, not too far from them.

Ash had found Pikachu, who had used Thundershock on him; Pikachu's condition was continuing to get worse. Suddenly, Pikachu sprints toward a cliff, delerious from its fever, and Ash dives after it, catching it and grabbing on to a branch. May helps Professor Birch pull the two back up, but as soon as they're back on solid ground, who else should show up but Team Rocket with an electricity absorbing machine, which they latch on to Pikachu with. Little do they know that that's exactly what Pikachu needed; after a few minutes, excess electricity stops coming out of Pikachu's electrical sacs, and it uses Thunderbolt to destroy Team Rocket's machine--and May's bike (sound familiar?).

Back at the lab, Pikachu's electrical pressure has returned to normal, and the next morning, Pikachu is in as good of health as it ever was. May is not very happy at her bike having been destroyed, but she is relieved, all the same, that Pikachu is all right. Then, having chosen a Torchic as her first Pok&#233;mon, May is getting ready to leave for Oldale Town, but since she doesn't have a bike she's afraid to walk alone, so she asks Ash to travel with her, which he agrees to (quote May: "<i>Yes!</i>"). So, the pair leave Littleroot for the Pok&#233;mon Center in Oldale to register for the Hoenn League.
