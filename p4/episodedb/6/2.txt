Ash and May are traveling on the road to Oldale Town. May spots a Azurill on the side of the road, and decides to try to catch it. First she tries just throwing a Pok&#233; Ball at it, but that doesn't work; Ash, who made the exact same mistake on his first day as a trainer, explains that she has to weaken the Pok&#233;mon first before catching it. So, May sends out Torchic, who chases the Azurill for a few minutes before Azurill finds its friends, Marril and Azumarril, who use Water Gun on and knock out Torchic. Ash tells May that all she has to do to heal her Torchic is take it to the nearest Pok&#233;mon Center, so the two set off again for Oldale.

Before reaching Oldale, the duo find a strange structure surrounded by a ring of tall rocks; Professor Alden appears and tells them that the structure is the Oldale Ruins, and when asked, tells them that the nearest Pok&#233;mon Center is in Oldale. At the Center, while May's Torchic is being treated, Alden explains his job to her and Ash: he is a Pok&#233;mon archaeologist, who was studying at the Oldale Ruins for clues to ancient Pok&#233;mon. Meanwhile, Team Rocket is calling Giovanni from a phone booth to say that they're in the Hoenn region and still on the trail of Pikachu. Giovanni says that if they can keep him informed of the activities of Teams Aqua and Magma, they will be able to head operations in Hoenn. This, of course, goes straight to the trio's heads, but by the time they can reply to the offer Giovanni has hung up.

Sepaking of Team Magma, while Ash, May, and Professor Alden are in the Professor's office in the Pok&#233;mon Center, several members of Team Magma cut the power and ask Alden to come with them. At first he refuses, but when Nurse Joy shows up the Magma members take her captive. Team Magma locks Ash, May, and Nurse Joy in a storage room, but Pikachu leads Ash and May through the air conditioning ducts to the lobby, where Ash turns on the backup power supply. Back at the Oldale Ruins, Team Magma is forcing Professor Alden to open the inner chamber of the Ruins, which he does, but Team Magma apparantly doesn't find what they're looking for, and leave. Ash and May show up soon after (right when Team Rocket does again, but they're soon taken care of), just in time to see an amazing event. When the sun rises, the four jewels used to open the chamber door light up in their sockets, causing light to stream through grooves in the wall, floor, and cieling of the chamber; the block in the center of the room then moves, revealing a staircase leading down to an underground lake where a large number of the ancient Pok&#233;mon Relicanth are living. (<i>Gomen nasai</i> (forgive me), I can't remember any more of the episode at this moment...I'll finish it as soon as I can! ^_^;;; Sorry....)
