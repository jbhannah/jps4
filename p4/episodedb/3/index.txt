<i>Everybody wants to be a master<br>
Everybody wants to show their skill<br>
Everybody wants to get there faster<br>
Make their way to the top of the hill<br>
Each time you try<br>
Gonna get just a little bit better<br>
Each step you climb<br>
Is one more step up the ladder
<p>
It's a whole new world we live in<br>
It's a whole new way to see<br>
It's a whole new place<br>
With a brand new attitude<br>
But you still gotta catch 'em all<br>
And be the best that you can be<br>

Everbody wants to call their mark<br>
To stand alone in the victory circle<br>
Stake their claim where the music starts<br>
Give it all you've got<br>
You can be the very best ever<br>
Take your best shot<br>
What you learn will come together

It's a whole new world we live in<br>
It's a whole new way to see<br>
It's a whole new place<br>

<p>
This season chronicles the travels of Ash, Misty, and Brock from New Bark Town to Goldenrod City in the Johto region. At the New Bark Town Pok&#233;mon Center, Ash registers for the Johto League, an organization similar to the Indigo League but with a new set of gyms and badges. The first person they meet is Professor Elm, once a student of Professor Oak's, who introduces them to the new Pok&#233;mon of the Johto region. The first new Pok&#233;mon Ash catches are Chikorita, Totodile, and Cyndaquil. Early in their adventures, Charizard leaves Ash to train at the Charicific Valley, a natural breeding ground for wild Charizard where they train and grow to above-average sizes and levels. As far as badges go, Ash earns his first two in this season: the Zephyr Badge from Faulkner in Violet City, and the Hive Badge from Bugsy in Azelea Town. And, yes, Team Rocket is still around and up to their old tricks (and still messing them up: their first fiasco is stealing a Totodile with Jessie's hair, which it clamped onto and wouldn't let go of). Otherwise, there's nothing much else to the season.
