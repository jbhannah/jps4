You win if you take your last Prize Card or ifyour opponent has no Benche Pok&eacute;mon to replace his or her Active Pok&eacute;mon if it gets Knocked Out or otherwize removed from play. Bur it might happen that both players "win" in one of these ways at the same time. If this happens, play Sudden Death.
