If a card tells you to do something to a certain number of the top cards of your deck, and you have fewer cards than that left in your deck, do whatever you are supposed to do to the cards that you have let an dcontinue play as normal. For example, if a card tells you to draw 7 cards or to look at the top 5 cards of your deck, and you have only 3 cards left in your deck, you draw the top 3 or look at the top 3. Remember, you lose if you cannot draw a card at the beginning of your turn, not if you cannot draw one because a card told you to.
