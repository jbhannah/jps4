If Sudden Death occurs, play a new game, but have each player use only 1 Prize Card instead of the usual 6. Except for the number of Prize Cards, treat the Sudden Death game like a whole new game: Set everything up again, including flipping a coin to see who goes first. The winner of the game is the overall winner. It may happen that the Sudden Death game also ends in Sudden Death; if that happens just keep playing Sudden Death games until somebody wins.
