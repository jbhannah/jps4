Sometimes a Pok&eacute;mon refers to itself by name. For example, Horsea's Retaliate attack says "Flip a coin. If heads, this attack does 10 damage times the number of damage counters on Horsea." Read the name as "this Pok&eacute;mon if the attack somehow gets used by another Pok&eacute;mon. So, if Horsea evolves into Kingdra ex, and Kingdra ex attacks using Horsea's Retaliate attack, the attack deals damage based on the damage counters on Kingra ex.
