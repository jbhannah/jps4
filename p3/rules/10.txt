If a Pok&eacute;mon is Asleep, Confused, or Paralyzed, and a new attack is made against it that makes it Asleep, Confused, or Paralyzed, the old condition is erased and only the new one counts. But these three conditions are the only attack effects that can erase each other. So, for example, a Pok&eacute;mon can be Confused and Burned at the same time.
