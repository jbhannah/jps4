Anything written on a Basic Pok&eacute;mon or Evolution card under the picture where attacks are found (except for a Pok&eacute;-Power or Pok&eacute;-Body) is considered an attack even if it does not do damage to your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon. So, for example, Team Aqua's Electrike's Self Charge and Bulbasaur's Growth would be prevented by an effect like Horsea's Smokescreen.
