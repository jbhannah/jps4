To make a new deck, first notice that all of the cards other than the Trainers have different Energy types on them. Your deck should probably include one or two of the basic Energy types, and you can choose to add some Colorless (<IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle>) Pok&eacute;mon if you like. If you just choose one Energy type, you will always have the right kind of Energy for your Pok&eacute;mon but not as much variety. If you have several Energy types, you will have more Pok&eacute;mon to choose from, but you will run the risk of sometimes not drawing the right type of Energy for your Pok&eacute;mon. And be sure your deck has enough Energy cards (most decks need 20 to 25).
<P>
Once you choose your Energy types, pick Pok&eacute;mon and Trainer cards that work well together. Do you want to build up big Pok&eacute;mon to crush your opponent? Then put in a lot of Evolution cards and some Trainer cards, like Pok&eacute; Ball, that help you find those Evolution cards.

After you make your deck, play it as often as you can against as many other decks as you can. See what works and what does not, and then make changes. If you keep working at it, you will have a deck that will show everyone you are the greatest Pok&eacute;mon Master of all time!
