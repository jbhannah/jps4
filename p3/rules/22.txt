Sometimes neither you nor your opponent get any Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards in your first hands of 7 cards. If this happens, both players shuffle and draw 7 new cards. In this case, neither player gets to draw an extra card. Repeat this process until at least one of the players has a Basic Pok&eacute;mon card in his or her hand of 7 cards. If the other player still does not have a  Basic Pok&eacute;mon card in his or her hand, that player can shuffle and draw 7 new cards, but the player who already has a Basic Pok&eacute;mon card can draw an extra card as usual. Continue this process until each player has a Basic Pok&eacute;mon in his or her hand of 7 cards.
