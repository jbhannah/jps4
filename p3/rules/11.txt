One of the things that makes the Pok&eacute;mon game different from other card games is that it is a trading card game. This means that there are lots of different cards that you can collect and trade with your friends. Also, you are not limited to just playing the preconstructed decks you buy &ndash; you can use all of the different cards you have to create totally new decks! A lot of the fun of a trading card game comes from making different decks that use different strategies.

<IMG src="p3/rules/birch.gif" alt="Professor Birch says..." align=left>Your deck has to have exactly 60 cards, and you cannot have more than 4 of any one card other than basic Energy cards in your deck (the basic Energy cards are <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/grass.gif" align=middle>,<IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/fire.gif" align=middle>,<IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/water.gif" align=middle>,<IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/lightning.gif" align=middle>,<IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/psychic.gif" align=middle> and <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/fighting.gif" align=middle>). A card counts as the same as another card if it has the same name &ndash; it does not matter whether the cards have different art or come from different sets. So, for example, you could have 4 Team Magma's Poochyena and 4 Poochyena if your deck, but you cannot have more than 4 Pok&eacute;mon named Poochyena total even if they were diferent versions of Poochyena.
