Paying Retreat Costs can get counfusing with Double Energy cards. Here is the way it works: Discard Energy cards one at a time until you have paid the Retreat Cost (or maybe more). Once you have paid the cost, you cannot discard any more cards.
<P>
For example, suppose your Pok&eacute;mon has a Retreat Cost of <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle><IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle> and it has two <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/fire.gif" align=middle> Energy cards and a <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle><IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle> Energy card attached. You can pay the Retreat Cost in several ways &ndash; by discarding <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle><IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle>, by discarding 2 <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/fire.gif" align=middle>, or by discarding <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/fire.gif" align=middle> first and then <IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle><IMG src="p3/db/images/elements/colorless.gif" align=middle>. You cannot discard all 3 cards though.
