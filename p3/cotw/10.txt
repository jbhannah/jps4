$review="This card is even better than the <A href=\"p3_cardoftheweek.php?week=5\">Blastoise ex</A> that I reviewed earlier on; it provides just as effective&mdash;and possible even more so&mdash;of a power-up method, and its attacks are simply devestating. How it works is, you put Bulbasaur on the bench early in the game and leave it there, powering up your other Pok&eacute;mon and preserving their Energy cards as much as possible. Then, when you get this bad boy out on the field, switch it in and have it suck up all of the stored Energy from your other Pok&eacute;mon, and proceed to beat the crap out of your opponent. Pollen Hazard is THE most painful attack I've ever seen on a card, with the potential to do 100 damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon between your attack and your next turn without you having to do a thing: you attack, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon takes 20 from the attack itself, 10 from Poison and 20 from Burn (on a tails coin flip), 20 again from Confusion (on another tails coin flip), and finally 10 more from Poison and 20 more from Burn (on a third tails coin flip, which is entirely possible). And then Solarbeam is just flat-out punishing, giving 90 damage for a reasonable 5 (which is very easy to get with this card). This card alone will make grass a definite contender in the modified format.";
