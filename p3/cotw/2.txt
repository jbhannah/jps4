$review="If Mewtwo ex is broken, then Team Aqua's Walrein is flat-out godly. First off, it's got 120HP, which is really high (even though there have been Pok&eacute;mon with as many as 200). On top of that, it has 2 type compatabilities&mdash;water and dark&mdash;so all effects that come with one type or the other apply to it (such as immunity to damage given by Dark Energy); that means that it has 2 weaknesses, but one is against an obscure type, and there are very few Pok&eacute;mon of the other type that can take this thing out quickly enough. And it has a retreat cost of 2. But then you get to its attacks, and you'll see why anyone whom this comes up opposite to should forfeit. Power Blow does a minimum of 20 damage per turn (10 base, plus 10 for the energy attached to use the attack), and when you get Hydro Reverse powered up on turn 3 or 4 after Team Aqua's Walrein comes out your opponent has no chance. The ability to return as many Water Energy from your side of the field to your hand in exchange for dealing an additional 10 (on top of the 50 base) damage per energy has got to be one of, if not the best effects printed on any Pok&eacute;mon card. Another thing is, its lower stages can hold their own while you wait to draw this card: Team Aqua's Spheal needs 1 Water Energy to do 10 damage and put the opponent to sleep; Team Aqua's Sealeo has some pretty solid attacks and 80HP; and both have low retreat costs (1 and 2) and are weak only against Steel Pok&eacute;mon. If any card newer than Neo Genesis Sneasel were to be banned from organized play, this would be it. What's better is that it can be gotten from the Team Aqua theme deck for about $10; the deck itself is a really good investment. (It'll be featured in the Deck Garage sometime next week.) ";
