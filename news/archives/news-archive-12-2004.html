<TD width=420>Among the things I got were Chris Fulop's Blaziken Tech World Championships 2004 deck, so that'll be in the deck garage later on this week. I also got a load of other cards, so look for a lot more activity to start happening in the TCG sections of this site. Right now, though, all there is are two new Cards of the Week: EX FireRed/LeafGreen's Charmeleon and Shadowclash's Whisking Whirlwind.<br><br>Once again, the forums are now up, so if you visit this site regularly you should consider joining them. You might be saying, "if there's nothing there then why should I join?" Well, you should join to put something there! And if you join, then other people will start to join, and thus things will start happening. w00t. :P</TD>

<TD width=420>Yeah, the forums are up for real this time, and they actually work. I decided to downgrade to <A href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target=_blank>phpBB</A> 2.0.11 and trust to the fact that there'll be an upgrade tool when phpBB 2.2 comes out. There are a bunch of interesting forums, such as Pok&eacute;mon and Duel Masters TCG casual play and discussion forums, anime and video game forums, plus one where I'll post stuff about the site and polls about what I should put up next. As of now I'm the only member, so be sure to join.<br><br>There are now several crafts, recipies, and games related to the EX Team Rocket Returns expansion available on <A href="http://pokemon-tcg.com/p_news/archives/news_461.jsp" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A>. All of them are in Adobe PDF format, so make sure you have the latest version of <A href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" target=_blank>Adobe Reader</A>.<br><br>I've uploaded a bunch of data files for Shadowclash of Blinding Night cards, since that seems to be one of the more popular search terms that brings people here. In the next few days I'll try to have that section finished.</TD>

<TD width=420>That's right, the title of the next Pok&eacute;mon game has been announced. Pok&eacute;mon Emerald Version will be released this spring for Game Boy Advance; more info will be posted soon on <A href="http://www.pokemon-games.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-games.com</A>.<br><br>If you have a My Nintendo account at <A href="http://www.nintendo.com/" target=_blank>nintendo.com</A>, you can now post your favorite six-Pok&eacute;mon battle team on <A href="http://forums.nintendo.com/nintendo/board/message?board.id=pokemon&message.id=49211" target=_blank>this thread</A> at the NSider Forums (including attacks, abilities, held items, and a short description). If your team is good enough, it might be selected as Battle Team of the Week on Pok&eacute;mon-games.com. (Right now, though, there are 104 pages in the thread, so I wouldn't try to read through all of them and would just straightaway click "Reply". Also, though there were previously, there are no region restrictions; you can use any of the 384 Pok&eacute;mon in existence in your team.)<br><br>This week's Cards of the Week are up today (keeping with what I said last week about moving them to Monday); this time it's Venusaur ex (EX FireRed/LeafGreen) and Snake Attack (Rampage of the Super Warriors). I've also made a lot of mechanical updates, such as rewriting the Deck Garage, fan fiction, and Card of the Week pages; none of those changes are currently visible, though.</TD>

<TD width=420>Nevermind what I said earlier about there not being much to post about. I just got the 8th issue of the D-MAX e-mail newsletter, and it has plenty of news to post about.<br><br>The Duel Masters JDC league tournament season is now underway, with events being hosted by a variety of game and card shops (an event locator is available at <a href="http://www.duelmasters.com/">http://www.duelmasters.com/</a>). League events are held at a recurring time, and are Swiss-style modified format, with a single-elimination round-of-eight at the end to determine the top eight finishers' rankings (previous rounds' rankings are points-based, and all pairings are points-determined). Two holofoil promo cards are available through events: the first 32 people to register get Torcon (2-cost 1000 Nature/Beast Folk), and the top 8 finishers get Marinomancer (5-cost 2000 Water/Cyber Lord; on summon, put all Darkness and Light cards from among the top 3 cards in your deck in your hands, put the rest of the 3 in the graveyard). The promo cards available will vary from season to season, so I'll post updated info on those when I get it.<br><br>Duel Masters will be appearing at a variety of gaming conventions in 2005, such as GenCon Indy and Origins, ComicCon, and Wizards World. There will be DCI-sanctioned tournaments, booster drafts, and casual league matches and tournaments, all with better prizes than the JDC league events; plus merchendise, demos, and freebies in the exhibitors' hall. Again, I'll post more info when I get it (whenever I hear word of a con at which Pok&eacute;mon or DM will be appearing or featured).<br><br><IMG src="news/20041217_1.jpg" align=right>The DVD/VHS release of "Duel Masters: The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Bolshack" will be on 25 January 2005 (thus, the DM release dates page is now up). Plus, "Duel Masters: Kaijudo Showdown" for GBA and "Duel Masters" for PS2 are now available, featuring all 300 cards from Base Set through Shadowclash.<br><br>There's also some new Pok&eacute;mon news out, too. Until 2 January 2005 at the Pok&eacute;mon Center New York, Pok&eacute;mon eggs will be available for wireless download to patrons who bring their Pok&eacute;mon FireRed or LeafGreen cartridges and a wireless adapter to the 2nd floor Gotta Catch 'Em All station. When the egg hatches, the Pok&eacute;mon that comes from it will have abilities that the Pok&eacute;mon doesn't normally have. And, Pok&eacute;mon FireRed finished behind Metroid Zero Mission for Best Handheld at the Spike VGA 2004.<br><br>Articles from <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/8b&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0008" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A>, <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/8a&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0008" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A>, and <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=585" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>Now at <a href="http://op.pokemon-tcg.com/">http://op.pokemon-tcg.com/</a>, you can create a My Pok&eacute;mon account with your POP ID (if you have one; if not, you can get one when you create an account) and view your tournament stats, take the Professor Program test, and more. (I myself have some more studying to do; I got 16/25 on the test, and a score of 20 is needed to pass.)<br><br>It's finals season at school, which is why I havn't updated for more than a week. The jps4 Topsites are now up and running, for the most part. I've also almost finished the download script, so the downloads pages will be up soon. I posted last week's Cards of the Week on Monday, and will have this week's on Friday; starting next week, I'll be posting them on Monday, so that I can do them over the weekend without having any conflicts during the week.</TD>
