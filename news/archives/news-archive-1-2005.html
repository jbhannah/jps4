<TD width=420>The Survivors of the Megapocalypse Duel Masters TCG expansion was released yesterday, and this month's D-MAX packets were sent out earlier this week with a Megapocalypse set poster, Billion-Degree Dragon art poster, Giriel, Ghastly Warrior (Super Warriors #S3) magnet, Gargako Dragon paper model, and the usual assortment of stickers and ads. Also, the letter mentions that starting this year, all D-MAX members will recieve exclusive awards for attending a certain number of tournaments: a Duel Masters promo card for every 3, and a unique collectors item for every 15 events. The items will be included in the next D-MAX mailing (which is DCI-number tracked). The Super Rares, Very Rares, and Light civilization cards from Megapocalypse are now up on their set's database page (see the New & Updated Pages section on the right nav bar, or the Megapocalypse link on the Duel Masters menu).<br><br>I don't know why I haven't posted this yet (I've known about it for weeks), but "Pok&eacute;mon: Destiny Deoxys", the seventh Pok&eacute;mon movie, will air on Kids' WB! next Saturday, January 22, at 10am Eastern/9am Pacific. The DVD/VHS release will be on February 15.<br><br><A href="http://op.pokemon-tcg.com/events/faqs/2004-2005/worlds_press_release.asp" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20050115_1.jpg" align=right></A>The 2005 Pok&eacute;mon TCG World Championships will be held from August 19 to August 21 at the Town and Country Resort and Convention Center, San Diego, California.

<TD width=420>New info has been released about the upcoming Survivors of the Megapocalypse DM set. The big news about it is that it introduces three new concepts to the game: Speed Attacker, which lets a creature attack the turn it comes into play (a direct adaptation of Haste, for you Magic g33ks); Triple Breaker, which is exactly what it sounds like; and Survivors. Each civ gets 10 creatures and 2 spells, and from what it looks like this set is really going to start making the game interesting (with a lot of twists from Magic...).<br><br><A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/9a&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0009" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20050111_1.gif" align=right></A>Survivors of the Megapocalypse prerelease tournaments will be held this Saturday and Sunday, January 15 and 16, at wherever JDC events are held (check <a href="http://www.duelmasters.com/">http://www.duelmasters.com/</a> for locations). The tournaments will be modified Swiss-style sealed-deck (each participant will recieve five Megapocalypse booster packs and will build their deck from that); the first 32 duelists to register get Olgate, Nightmare Samurai (see below) and the top 4 finishers get...more Megapocalypse boosters.<br><br>The January Duel Masters JDC prize cards have been announced: Olgate, Nightmare Samurai for the first 32 to register at each event (this card isn't available in a set; 7-for-6000 double breaker demon command; untap whenever one of your creatures is destroyed), and Ballus, Dogfight Enforcer Q from Megapocalypse (5-for-3000; untap whenever your turn ends) for the top 8 finishers.<br><br>Articles from <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/9b&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0009" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A> and <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/9a&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0009" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>Yeah, sorry about the delay; I've been swamped with school lately, and putting everything together has been more work than it might seem. The deck garage is up now and Chris Fulop's Blaziken Tech deck is the first review. The CotWs are EX FireRed/LeafGreen Beedrill and EvoCrushinators' Chaos Worm. News will be up tomorrow; this week's CotW on Friday.</TD>

<TD width=420>Pokémon has been listed as number 46 on The Essential 50 video games list by 1UP.com, a list of video games that revolutionized the world of video gaming. The Pokémon series is named as the game that changed the weak reputation of handheld gaming as a novelty, and was the first "Game Boy game that used the system's unique linking ability to promote trading and collecting items within the game." (Also among The Essential 50 are the original Super Mario Kart, Myst, Half Life, Doom, Tetris, and Pong. The full list can be viewed at <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116290.">http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116290.</a>)<br><br>I was out of town for part of this week, but I am working on the first Deck Garage entry; I'll have it up by next Wednesday. (If you missed my mentioning it previously, it's the Blaziken Teck Worlds 2004 deck.)<br><br>Article from <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/games/videogames/index.asp?articleID=587" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A> and <A href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3136194" target=_blank>1UP.com</A>.</TD>
