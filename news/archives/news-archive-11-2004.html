<TD width=420>Pok&eacute;mon FireRed has been nominated for the title of best handheld game in the second annual Spike TV Video Game Awards. The awards, hosted by Snoop Dogg, will air on Spike TV, December 14 at 9PM Eastern time; there will be several live performances, and games in 24 categories will be awarded best-of-the-year. To see a more complete list of nominees and to cast your vote for each catogory, visit <a href="http://www.spiketv.com/events/vga2004/.">http://www.spiketv.com/events/vga2004/.</a><br><br>Yes, I have no life: I spent at least three hours yesterday doing mostly two things with the site. First, I made the Pok&eacute;mon TCG rulebook section, using the exact text from the EX Team Magma vs. Team Aqua rulebook. Second, I completely rewrote the Pok&eacute;mon episode database script to make it easier for me to work with and update (I now only have to edit one file to change/add episode titles in one season). I also put up the new Cards of the Week: Base Set 1 Gyarados and King Depthcon. And, if you haven't noticed, we now have a new affiliate, <A href="http://www.duelmastersn.com/" target=_blank>Duel Masters Network</A>, and are on two Duel Masters topsites lists (be sure to click the buttons to vote for us!).<br><br>I know that I've previously promised a number of updates, such as episode reviews, card scans/database info, the Deck Garage, et cetera. Truth is, I've been way to busy lately to do much more than trivial updates and CotW. This weekend's not much better, since I'll be out of town until Monday. HOWEVER, winter break is right around the corner for me, so once that hits I'll be sure to work hard to get some more content up on the site.<br><br>Article from <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=576" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>Pretty much all DM news today, couldn't get to any of my Pok&eacute;mon sources. I got my copy of the latest D-MAX packet yesterday; it included a set poster for the Shadowclash of Blinding Night expansion (<A href="http://www.duelmasters.com/shadowclash/" target=_blank>released November 12</A>), a "signed" picture of the Ballom, Master of Death card art, stickers, and a magnet of Fighter Dual Fang. <br><br>More Duel Masters news: the Shadowclash Collectors Set tin is now available. It contains two 40-card decks with four premium cards and two more premium cards--two of which (total) are preview cards from next year's Survivors of the Megapocalypse expansion. More info is at <a href="http://www.duelmasters.com/shadowclash/.">http://www.duelmasters.com/shadowclash/.</a> Duel Masters JDC tournaments are being held weekly; go to <a href="http://www.duelmasters.com/">http://www.duelmasters.com/</a> or call 1-800-324-6496 for locations and times. Duel Masters is airing on Cartoon Network at 6 AM on Monday-Friday, and 7 PM on Saturday. And, finally, the Tournament of the 5 Civilizations will begin December 11; all participants get a holofoil Holy Awe promo card, a deck box, and a cap. Visit duelmasters.com or call the number above for more info.<br><br>Two new Cards of the Week today: Blastoise ex from EX Ruby &amp; Sapphire, and Ballom, Master of Death from Shadowclash. (Neither are scans of the actual card, that's why they're a bit fuzzy/different.) The Pok&eacute;mon Deck Garage will go up early next week, and the DM Deck Garage the week after (I'll be away from the day after Thanksgiving through next Sunday, but updates will resume on Monday the 29th.)</TD>

Among a range of other games including Kirby and Super Mario 64, there was a Pok&eacute;mon game called Pok&eacute;mon Dash.

<TD width=420>Pok&eacute;mon TCG: 2004 World Championships Decks are available today; assuming they're the same as the Magic: The Gathering tournament decks, they're replicas of decks used in the recent Pok&eacute;mon TCG World Championships tournament.<br><br>I've started working on the Pok&eacute;mon card database, starting from the beginning with Base Set 1. Cards 1 through 9 are up, with scans for six of those (cards for which I don't have a scan instead have a scan of the card back; if you have a readable, usable scan for one of those cards e-mail me). There are also prices listed for each card; these don't imply that I'm selling those cards. The prices listed are what I'd be willing to pay or take for that card (based off of the prices in the October/November <A href="http://www.beckett.com/" target=_blank>Beckett Pok&eacute;mon Collector</A>).<br><br>Article from <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>Well, I've survived the first month. That's always a good sign. I definitely seem to be more dedicated to this site that I ever did with its predecessors; this is the 14th news post over 31 days, which is pretty good. Anyway, the first Duel Masters Card of the Week (Hanusa, Radiance Elemental), the Duel Masters card database page (with only one card), and the Duel Masters menu are now up. The pages listed under "Main" on the left, plus the "Users  Online" page now show a random menu if you haven't already selected one; you can switch menus and come back here to the index page by using the links at the top of the left menu bar (a bit of programming genius on my part, the dual-menu design). The fourth Pok&eacute;mon CotW is up too: Sabrina's Alakazam. As far as the forums go, I had them working for a short time yesterday, but then they collapsed again. Status: still unusable.<br><br><A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=572" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20041112_1.jpg" align=right></A><A href="http://www.kidswb.com/" target=_blank>Kids' WB</A> is two weeks into their Newvember promotion. Every Saturday morning they're showing two new episodes of Pok&eacute;mon Advanced Challenge, at 8 and 10AM. New episodes this month span from May's second Pok&eacute;mon contest in Slateport City to Ash's battle in the Lavaridge Town Gym. Also, during the week Kids' WB is showing two reruns of Pok&eacute;mon from 3 to 4PM. (An updated episode list will go up soon, possibly tomorrow or Sunday.)<br><br><A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=571" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20041112_2.jpg" align=left></A><A href="http://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon Center NY</A> is celebrating their third anniversary tomorrow from 11AM to 3PM. One of the main events will be the Pok&eacute;mon Trivia Challenge, with events being held for attendees 12 and under at noon, and for those over 12 at 2PM. Pikachu will be available for photographs at the Center from 11AM to noon.<br><br>Prerelease tournaments for the upcoming Duel Masters expansion, Shadowclash of Blinding Night, will be held nationwide tomorrow. The tournament format will be sealed-deck, modified Swiss-style double-elimination, and the tournaments will be DCI-sanctioned (if you're a D-MAX member or have a DCI number, your progress will be tracked and you will be put in the overall Duel Masters DCI rankings). DuelMasters.com says that the first 32 players will get an exclusive holofoil promo card, but it doesn't specify whether that's the first 32 players to register or the top 32 finishing players. A list of tournament locations is available <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/leaguestable/shadowlocations" target=_blank>here</A>, or by calling 1-800-324-6496.<br><br>Articles from <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=571" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>, <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=572" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>, and <A href="http://www.duelmasters.com/" target=_blank>DuelMasters.com</A>.</TD>

The Pok&eacute;mon "star" have a new foil treatment and artwork, and introduce some new abilities to the game, but it sounds like they'll be comparable in rarity to the "Shining" Pok&eacute;mon from Neo Destiny.<br><br>Starting Monday, booster packs containing 1 reverse holofoil, 1 rare, 2 uncommon, and 5 common cards will sell for MSRP $3.29; and 60-card theme decks including an updated rulebook, Team Rocket-themed game coin, half-playmat, one holofoil card, and a card checklist will sell for MSRP $10.99.<br><br>Speaking of Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com, their PDF-format checklists haven't been working lately, so I'll have to work with the limited information available from the paper checklist from my brother's Team Aqua deck.
