<TD width=420>That's right, the second Card of the Week is up today, and this time it's Team Aqua's Walrein from the EX Team Aqua vs. Team Magma set. (This has got to be one of my favorite cards ever made. Read the review for more.) The Team Aqua deck will also come under the microscope sometime next week in the Deck Garage, so watch for that.<br><br>The Pok&eacute;mon Center NYC is having a Halloween party this Saturday. There will be Pok&eacute;mon costume contests, music &amp; games, and Pok&eacute;mon Mini tournaments. Also, trainers with FireRed or LeafGreen can get the Aurora Ticket from this event, which is needed to catch Deoxys. (See the Pok&eacute;mon Rocks America 2004 article below.)<br><br>In the TCG world, two new products are available: the <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_news/archives/news_413.jsp" target=_blank>EX Battle Stadium</A> pack, which has 2 60-card theme decks, 4 10-card sideboard packs, a full-size playmat, and more; and <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_news/archives/news_416.jsp" target=_blank>EX Deck Tins</A>, which come in 4 designs and include 2 EX series booster packs, a holofoil card, and a Pok&eacute;mon sticker pack. Coming soon, there will be <A href="http://op.pokemon-tcg.com/events/faqs/ex7_prerelease_faq.asp">Pok&eacute;mon TCG: EX Team Rocket Returns Prerelease Tournaments</A> being held presumably nationwide, and each participant gets a free EX Team Rocket Returns booster. (The link is the one given on <A href="http://www.op.pokemon-tcg.com/" target=_blank>http://www.op.pokemon-tcg.com/</A>, but at the time I posted this it didn't work. More info when the page does work.)<br><br>Articles from <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=567" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A> and <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>I made the display page for the card database, but there's only 1 card there so far. That'll be my next project, along with more episode reviews.<br><br>Also, <A href="http://www.beckett.com/" target=_blank>Beckett's Pok&eacute;mon Collector</A> is back with a special issue released a couple of weeks ago. It has a <u>complete</u> price guide of everything from the original Base Set 1 to EX FireRed &amp; LeafGreen.</TD>

As usual, there were attractions such as costumed characters, TCG and video game booths, tournaments, and carnival games; new with the 2004 tour was the Union Room, where attendees with Pok&eacute;mon FireRed or LeafGreen could battle and trade wirelessly via the adapter included with the game. On the original article page (linked below), there are Flash applets with photo slideshows and videos from the event. There wasn't an end-of-day recap available as of this update, but I'll post one tomorrow.<br><br>Article from <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=565" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>The first Card of the Week (plus the CotW archive page) is up: Mewtwo <I>ex</I> from EX: Ruby &amp; Sapphire. Also, I redid the episode list from jps&sup3; and uploaded here, so now an at least partial episode list is available under Episode Database.<br><br>I'm not gonna be able to do much work on the site over the weekend (I'll be out of town all Saturday), but starting Monday I'll begin posting news, both here in detail with links and on the news ticker in the upper-right corner (under where it says "Latest News"), and I'll also try to dig up some release dates.</TD>

<TD width=420>I wasn't able to do another episode review yet (been too busy with schoolwork and other stuff), but I did get the Credits &amp; Legal page put up. Also, the first Card of the Week will go up this Friday, so stay tuned for that.</TD>

<TD align=center width=65><A href="mailto:jb@jps.hostultra.com"><IMG src="/site/img/_jb_.gif" alt="<?php echo $user; ?>"></A></TD>
<TD width=420>I adapted all of the episode reviews that I'd had on jps&sup3; into a format that could be used with this site, saved them as text files, and uploaded them, plus the season reviews that I'd written. Thus, there is now something to look at in the episode reviews section. I also changed and reuploaded the About jps4 page. (If you'll notice on the right menu bar, I've also added the part where you can see which pages were changed or added with the most recent update.) Tomorrow I'm going to try to have the Credits/Legal page ready to upload, along with possibly another episode review.</TD>

<TD align=center width=65><A href="mailto:jb@jps.hostultra.com"><IMG src="/site/img/_jb_.gif" alt="<?php echo $user; ?>"></A></TD>
<TD width=420>I've uploaded phpBB 2.1.2 as the forums; however, it's only a beta version of version 2.2 (which will be out later this year), so it doesn't work very well. So far, I've verified that the avatar upload feature doesn't work, and can't post announcements and have been having problems with some things on the admin control panel, so there won't be much happening on the forums yet.<br><br>In other news, the first major part of the site that I'm going to work on will be the anime episode reviews. Hopefully I'll be able to put at least a few of those up during the week.</TD>

<TD width=420>Yes, we're up. Granted, we only have five or so pages (not that I'm counting), but other than that the site is up and operating as normally as possible. Right now all that works is the Red/Blue walkthrough, the fanfics section, and the "About" page (which'll be changed soon), but I'm making good progress on finishing other sections of the site, and as soon as I'm finished with a page I'll put it up. (The DuelMasters menu doesn't work either; that's next on my list.)</TD>
