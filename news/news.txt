There are ex and non-ex cards for each of Deoxys' three forms&mdash;normal, attack, and defense&mdash;and all three share the Pok&eacute;-Power "Form Change", which allows you to switch from one to another at will. There are also Rayquaza and Jirachi cards, "star" Latios and Latias cards, and a number of trainers (including Meteor Falls, which allows your evolved Pok&eacute;mon to use attacks from its previous stages). The set has a total of 107 cards (83 Pok&eacute;mon, 12 trainers, 9 Pok&eacute;mon-ex, and 3 Pok&eacute;mon "star").<br><br><A href="http://pokemon.com/games/tcg/index.asp?articleID=595" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20050211_2.jpg" align=left></A>Two theme decks will also be available: Starcharge and Jetstream (each featuring Deoxys and Rayquaza, respectively, and containing the usual mix of theme deck stuff). Once I get my hands on one, the rulebook here will be updated to that version.<br><br>I uploaded this week's Cards of the Week&mdash;Neo Destiny's Dark Typhlosion, and Megapocalypse's La Byle, Seeker of the Winds&mdash;today, and put up the name and screenshot for next week's Japanese Pok&eacute;mon episode. (I haven't been able to find US episode information for Pok&eacute;mon, and both US and Japan episode information for Duel Masters. If you have any ideas about where to find these, e-mail them to me or post them on the forums.)<br><br>Article from <A href="http://pokemon.com/games/tcg/index.asp?articleID=595" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>The next Pok&eacute;mon TCG expansion, EX Deoxys, will be released this coming Valentine's Day; again, all the information I have for it at this point is that it will contain "over 100 new cards, all new Pok&eacute;mon 'star', new trainer and special energy cards, and Pok&eacute;mon-ex!" Nintendo's pretty good at keeping details of things under wraps until they're released....<br><br>The February Duel Masters JDC promos have been announced: <A href="d3_database.php?set=5&card=26">Gigakail</A> as the participation card and <A href="d3_database.php?set=5&card=53">Nocturnal Giant</A> as the premium card for the top finishers. Both are alternate-holofoil versions of Megapocalypse release cards.<br><br>Yes, I know it's been two weeks since I last updated; busy is an understatement when used to describe how the past couple of weeks have been for me. Anyway, I have last week's Cards of the Week up (Fossil Gengar and Avalanche Giant) and plan to have this week's up on Thursday, getting back to the regular schedule next week.<br><br>Articles from <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A> and <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/11a&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0011" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A>.</TD>

<TD width=420>Starting January 28, McDonald's will be giving away one of 15 exclusive Duel Masters promo cards with each Happy Meal; ten of the cards offered are alternate-art versions of existing cards, but the other five are original releases.<br><br>Mindy Lambkee, 2002 Pok&eacute;mon Worlds champion, has written an article about how she got into Duel Masters and comparing it to Pok&eacute;mon and Yu-Gi-Oh! According to her, in Duel Masters you don't need to worry about some things that you do in other games; for example, "you don't need space in your deck for mana. You don't have problems finding mana either because every card in the deck can be a mana card!" She also included the list of her first deck, which will be up in the Deck Garage in the next few days. You can read her full article <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/10b&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0010" target=_blank>here</A>.<br><br>The Duel Masters Tournament of the 5 Civilizations regionals will be held nationwide and in Canada, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico, on February 12, 2005. The first 50 people to register at each location will get an exclusive promo card and a cap, and the prizes are very alluring: a Champion Plaque and Megapocalypse booster box for first place; twelve Megapocalypse boosters for second; and six Megapocalypse boosters apiece for third and fourth places. It's DCI sanctioned (and worth 24,000!), constructed format, and there will be two age divisions (14-under and 15-up). A list of tournament locations is available <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/5civ/survivors&tablesort=5&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0010" target=_blank>here</A>.<br><br>Speaking of Megapocalypse, I finished off the database for it yesterday; you can now look up the text of any card in that set on this site (next up is Shadowclash). This week's Cards of the Week are on schedule: Blaziken ex and Billion-Degree Dragon (you knew that was coming, didn't you? :P). Other than that, nothing worth posting here.<br><br>Articles from <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/10a&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0010" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A>, <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/10b&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0010" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A>, and <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/5civ/survivors&tablesort=5&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0010" target=_blank>Wizards.com</A>.</TD>

A Flash trailer is available at <A href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=ja_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fpokemon2005.jp%2ftop.html" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon2005.jp</A> (the link is to the Babelfish translated version of the site). (In the future, this site will have more reliable news on Japanese Pok&eacute;mon happenings; I start taking Japanese at the local community college next semester, so by the end of the year I'll be getting up-to-speed on that.)<br><br>Other than that, no news today. I've been updating the Pok&eacute;mon "Next Anime Episodes" section on the right nav bar; you can view them if you have the Pok&eacute;mon menu open. CotWs and the rest of the Megapocalypse (and possible some of the Shadowclash) card database(s) will go up Monday.</TD>
