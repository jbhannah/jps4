More EX Deoxys news``x_JB_``x<A href="http://pokemon.com/games/tcg/index.asp?articleID=595" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20050211_1.jpg" align=right></A>Pok&eacute;mon.com has posted an article giving a bit of a preview of the EX Deoxys TCG expansion. There are ex and non-ex cards for each of Deoxys' three forms&mdash;normal, attack, and defense&mdash;and all three share the Pok&eacute;-Power "Form Change", which allows you to switch from one to another at will. There are also Rayquaza and Jirachi cards, "star" Latios and Latias cards, and a number of trainers (including Meteor Falls, which allows your evolved Pok&eacute;mon to use attacks from its previous stages). The set has a total of 107 cards (83 Pok&eacute;mon, 12 trainers, 9 Pok&eacute;mon-ex, and 3 Pok&eacute;mon "star").<br><br><A href="http://pokemon.com/games/tcg/index.asp?articleID=595" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20050211_2.jpg" align=left></A>Two theme decks will also be available: Starcharge and Jetstream (each featuring Deoxys and Rayquaza, respectively, and containing the usual mix of theme deck stuff). Once I get my hands on one, the rulebook here will be updated to that version.<br><br>I uploaded this week's Cards of the Week&mdash;Neo Destiny's Dark Typhlosion, and Megapocalypse's La Byle, Seeker of the Winds&mdash;today, and put up the name and screenshot for next week's Japanese Pok&eacute;mon episode. (I haven't been able to find US episode information for Pok&eacute;mon, and both US and Japan episode information for Duel Masters. If you have any ideas about where to find these, e-mail them to me or post them on the forums.)<br><br>Article from <A href="http://pokemon.com/games/tcg/index.asp?articleID=595" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>.``xEEplEVupEloqAFEdus``x1108128818``x(default)
Pok&eacute;mon TCG: EX Deoxys``x_JB_``xThe next Pok&eacute;mon TCG expansion, EX Deoxys, will be released this coming Valentine's Day; again, all the information I have for it at this point is that it will contain "over 100 new cards, all new Pok&eacute;mon 'star', new trainer and special energy cards, and Pok&eacute;mon-ex!" Nintendo's pretty good at keeping details of things under wraps until they're released....<br><br>The February Duel Masters JDC promos have been announced: <A href="d3_database.php?set=5&card=26">Gigakail</A> as the participation card and <A href="d3_database.php?set=5&card=53">Nocturnal Giant</A> as the premium card for the top finishers.

DM McDonald's promos, 5 Civ tournament & CotW's``x_JB_``xStarting January 28, McDonald's will be giving away one of 15 exclusive Duel Masters promo cards with each Happy Meal; ten of the cards offered are alternate-art versions of existing cards, but the other five are original releases.<br><br>Mindy Lambkee, 2002 Pok&eacute;mon Worlds champion, has written an article about how she got into Duel Masters and comparing it to Pok&eacute;mon and Yu-Gi-Oh! According to her, in Duel Masters you don't need to worry about some things that you do in other games; for example, "you don't need space in your deck for mana. You don't have problems finding mana either because every card in the deck can be a mana card!" She also included the list of her first deck, which will be up in the Deck Garage in the next few days. You can read her full article <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/10b&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0010" target=_blank>here</A>.<br><br>The Duel Masters Tournament of the 5 Civilizations regionals will be held nationwide and in Canada, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico, on February 12, 2005. The first 50 people to register at each location will get an exclusive promo card and a cap, and the prizes are very alluring: a Champion Plaque and Megapocalypse booster box for first place; twelve Megapocalypse boosters for second; and six Megapocalypse boosters apiece for third and fourth places. It's DCI sanctioned (and worth 24,000!), constructed format, and there will be two age divisions (14-under and 15-up).

Survivors of the Megapocalypse prerelese info & tournaments``x_JB_``xNew info has been released about the upcoming Survivors of the Megapocalypse DM set. The big news about it is that it introduces three new concepts to the game: Speed Attacker, which lets a creature attack the turn it comes into play (a direct adaptation of Haste, for you Magic g33ks); Triple Breaker, which is exactly what it sounds like; and Survivors. Each civ gets 10 creatures and 2 spells, and from what it looks like this set is really going to start making the game interesting (with a lot of twists from Magic...).<br><br><A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=duelmasters/news/9a&dcmp=EMC-DMAX0009" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20050111_1.gif" align=right></A>Survivors of the Megapocalypse prerelease tournaments will be held this Saturday and Sunday, January 15 and 16, at wherever JDC events are held (check <a href="http://www.duelmasters.com/">http://www.duelmasters.com/</a> for locations).

Pok&eacute;mon: #46 of The Essential 50``x_JB_``xPokémon has been listed as number 46 on The Essential 50 video games list by 1UP.com, a list of video games that revolutionized the world of video gaming. The Pokémon series is named as the game that changed the weak reputation of handheld gaming as a novelty, and was the first "Game Boy game that used the system's unique linking ability to promote trading and collecting items within the game." (Also among The Essential 50 are the original Super Mario Kart, Myst, Half Life, Doom, Tetris, and Pong. The full list can be viewed at <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116290.">http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116290.</a>)<br><br>I was out of town for part of this week, but I am working on the first Deck Garage entry; I'll have it up by next Wednesday.

Pok&eacute;mon Emerald Version``x_JB_``xThat's right, the title of the next Pok&eacute;mon game has been announced.

If your team is good enough, it might be selected as Battle Team of the Week on Pok&eacute;mon-games.com. (Right now, though, there are 104 pages in the thread, so I wouldn't try to read through all of them and would just straightaway click "Reply". Also, though there were previously, there are no region restrictions; you can use any of the 384 Pok&eacute;mon in existence in your team.)<br><br>This week's Cards of the Week are up today (keeping with what I said last week about moving them to Monday); this time it's Venusaur ex (EX FireRed/LeafGreen) and Snake Attack (Rampage of the Super Warriors).

D-MAX Newsletter Issue 8``x_JB_``xNevermind what I said earlier about there not being much to post about.

League events are held at a recurring time, and are Swiss-style modified format, with a single-elimination round-of-eight at the end to determine the top eight finishers' rankings (previous rounds' rankings are points-based, and all pairings are points-determined). Two holofoil promo cards are available through events: the first 32 people to register get Torcon (2-cost 1000 Nature/Beast Folk), and the top 8 finishers get Marinomancer (5-cost 2000 Water/Cyber Lord; on summon, put all Darkness and Light cards from among the top 3 cards in your deck in your hands, put the rest of the 3 in the graveyard). The promo cards available will vary from season to season, so I'll post updated info on those when I get it.<br><br>Duel Masters will be appearing at a variety of gaming conventions in 2005, such as GenCon Indy and Origins, ComicCon, and Wizards World. There will be DCI-sanctioned tournaments, booster drafts, and casual league matches and tournaments, all with better prizes than the JDC league events; plus merchendise, demos, and freebies in the exhibitors' hall. Again, I'll post more info when I get it (whenever I hear word of a con at which Pok&eacute;mon or DM will be appearing or featured).<br><br><IMG src="news/20041217_1.jpg" align=right>The DVD/VHS release of "Duel Masters: The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Bolshack" will be on 25 January 2005 (thus, the DM release dates page is now up).

It should all work; if you see any problems with anything e-mail me and let me know what's going on.<br><br>Articles from <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=577" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A> and <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A>.``xEEpEZFFyppbzqVzPlq``x1101708400``x(default)
Pok&eacute;mon invited to Spike TV Video Game Awards``x_JB_``xPok&eacute;mon FireRed has been nominated for the title of best handheld game in the second annual Spike TV Video Game Awards. The awards, hosted by Snoop Dogg, will air on Spike TV, December 14 at 9PM Eastern time; there will be several live performances, and games in 24 categories will be awarded best-of-the-year. To see a more complete list of nominees and to cast your vote for each catogory, visit <a href="http://www.spiketv.com/events/vga2004/.">http://www.spiketv.com/events/vga2004/.</a><br><br>Yes, I have no life: I spent at least three hours yesterday doing mostly two things with the site. First, I made the Pok&eacute;mon TCG rulebook section, using the exact text from the EX Team Magma vs. Team Aqua rulebook. Second, I completely rewrote the Pok&eacute;mon episode database script to make it easier for me to work with and update (I now only have to edit one file to change/add episode titles in one season). I also put up the new Cards of the Week: Base Set 1 Gyarados and King Depthcon. And, if you haven't noticed, we now have a new affiliate, <A href="http://www.duelmastersn.com/" target=_blank>Duel Masters Network</A>, and are on two Duel Masters topsites lists (be sure to click the buttons to vote for us!).<br><br>I know that I've previously promised a number of updates, such as episode reviews, card scans/database info, the Deck Garage, et cetera. Truth is, I've been way to busy lately to do much more than trivial updates and CotW. This weekend's not much better, since I'll be out of town until Monday. HOWEVER, winter break is right around the corner for me, so once that hits I'll be sure to work hard to get some more content up on the site.<br><br>Article from <A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=576" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A>.``xEEpEulAkAuuAAhDtFG``x1101464094``x(default)

Duel Masters news and new CotWs``x_JB_``xPretty much all DM news today, couldn't get to any of my Pok&eacute;mon sources. I got my copy of the latest D-MAX packet yesterday; it included a set poster for the Shadowclash of Blinding Night expansion (<A href="http://www.duelmasters.com/shadowclash/" target=_blank>released November 12</A>), a "signed" picture of the Ballom, Master of Death card art, stickers, and a magnet of Fighter Dual Fang. <br><br>More Duel Masters news: the Shadowclash Collectors Set tin is now available. It contains two 40-card decks with four premium cards and two more premium cards--two of which (total) are preview cards from next year's Survivors of the Megapocalypse expansion. More info is at <a href="http://www.duelmasters.com/shadowclash/.">http://www.duelmasters.com/shadowclash/.</a> Duel Masters JDC tournaments are being held weekly; go to <a href="http://www.duelmasters.com/">http://www.duelmasters.com/</a> or call 1-800-324-6496 for locations and times. Duel Masters is airing on Cartoon Network at 6 AM on Monday-Friday, and 7 PM on Saturday. And, finally, the Tournament of the 5 Civilizations will begin December 11; all participants get a holofoil Holy Awe promo card, a deck box, and a cap. Visit duelmasters.com or call the number above for more info.<br><br>Two new Cards of the Week today: Blastoise ex from EX Ruby &amp; Sapphire, and Ballom, Master of Death from Shadowclash. (Neither are scans of the actual card, that's why they're a bit fuzzy/different.) The Pok&eacute;mon Deck Garage will go up early next week, and the DM Deck Garage the week after (I'll be away from the day after Thanksgiving through next Sunday, but updates will resume on Monday the 29th.)``xEEppAEpZuVtfUkYXXe``x1100885545``x(default)
First DS Pok&eacute;mon game? and more card pages``x_JB_``x<A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=573" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20041116_1.jpg" align=right>Pok&eacute;mon.com</A> reporters were recently at the Nintendo World Touch! tour stop in Osaka, Japan. Among a range of other games including Kirby and Super Mario 64, there was a Pok&eacute;mon game called Pok&eacute;mon Dash. Not many details were posted about the game itself, but it's reported to utilize "almost all the aspects of the incredibly innovative Nintendo DS," including the stylus touchscreen, increased graphics capabilities and improved screen, and sound. The news article page has a Flash slideshow of pictures from the event.<br><br>I've uploaded the database files for Base Set 1 cards 10-16, the rest of the holofoils. On Friday I'll upload the pics for those, plus the pics and files for the next several cards, as well as the new Cards of the Week.``xEEppZEEykZjywpvYHL``x1100686427``x(default)
Pok&eacute;mon TCG news and database update``x_JB_``xPok&eacute;mon TCG: 2004 World Championships Decks are available today; assuming they're the same as the Magic: The Gathering tournament decks, they're replicas of decks used in the recent Pok&eacute;mon TCG World Championships tournament.<br><br>I've started working on the Pok&eacute;mon card database, starting from the beginning with Base Set 1. Cards 1 through 9 are up, with scans for six of those (cards for which I don't have a scan instead have a scan of the card back; if you have a readable, usable scan for one of those cards e-mail me). There are also prices listed for each card; these don't imply that I'm selling those cards. The prices listed are what I'd be willing to pay or take for that card (based off of the prices in the October/November <A href="http://www.beckett.com/" target=_blank>Beckett Pok&eacute;mon Collector</A>).<br><br>Article from <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A>.``xEEppVFFlkFhKzbpDBy``x1100508623``x(default)
One month! plus DM &amp; Pok&eacute;mon CotWs, news, and more``x_JB_``xWell, I've survived the first month. That's always a good sign. I definitely seem to be more dedicated to this site that I ever did with its predecessors; this is the 14th news post over 31 days, which is pretty good. Anyway, the first Duel Masters Card of the Week (Hanusa, Radiance Elemental), the Duel Masters card database page (with only one card), and the Duel Masters menu are now up. The pages listed under "Main" on the left, plus the "Users  Online" page now show a random menu if you haven't already selected one; you can switch menus and come back here to the index page by using the links at the top of the left menu bar (a bit of programming genius on my part, the dual-menu design). The fourth Pok&eacute;mon CotW is up too: Sabrina's Alakazam. As far as the forums go, I had them working for a short time yesterday, but then they collapsed again. Status: still unusable.<br><br><A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=572" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20041112_1.jpg" align=right></A><A href="http://www.kidswb.com/" target=_blank>Kids' WB</A> is two weeks into their Newvember promotion. Every Saturday morning they're showing two new episodes of Pok&eacute;mon Advanced Challenge, at 8 and 10AM. New episodes this month span from May's second Pok&eacute;mon contest in Slateport City to Ash's battle in the Lavaridge Town Gym. Also, during the week Kids' WB is showing two reruns of Pok&eacute;mon from 3 to 4PM. (An updated episode list will go up soon, possibly tomorrow or Sunday.)<br><br><A href="http://www.pokemon.com/events/index.asp?articleID=571" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20041112_2.jpg" align=left></A><A href="http://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon Center NY</A> is celebrating their third anniversary tomorrow from 11AM to 3PM. One of the main events will be the Pok&eacute;mon Trivia Challenge, with events being held for attendees 12 and under at noon, and for those over 12 at 2PM. Pikachu will be available for photographs at the Center from 11AM to noon.<br><br>Prerelease tournaments for the upcoming Duel Masters expansion, Shadowclash of Blinding Night, will be held nationwide tomorrow. The tournament format will be sealed-deck, modified Swiss-style double-elimination, and the tournaments will be DCI-sanctioned (if you're a D-MAX member or have a DCI number, your progress will be tracked and you will be put in the overall Duel Masters DCI rankings). DuelMasters.com says that the first 32 players will get an exclusive holofoil promo card, but it doesn't specify whether that's the first 32 players to register or the top 32 finishing players.

EX Team Rocket Returns &amp; CotW Week 3``x_JB_``xPok&eacute;mon-E TCG EX Team Rocket Returns boosters and themedecks are (should be) available today at Toys 'R' Us and most other places where Pok&eacute;mon and other TCG cards are sold, for $3.29 for a booster pack and $10.99 for a theme deck.<br><br>Card of the Week number 3 is up today too, and it's a bit of a throwback to the early days of the game with the Base Set 1/2 Electrode and its famous Buzzap Pok&eacute;mon Power. (This is actually last week's CotW; this week's will go up on Friday, as scheduled.)<br><br>I don't have school this Thursday (for Veteran's Day), so I'll try to put in a few hours to getting stuff written and put up. First priority will be TCG set lists.``xEpAAAuylyyeLHZdUuK``x1099921666``x(default)
EX Team Rocket Returns update``x_JB_``x<A href="http://pokemon-tcg.com/p_news/archives/news_424.jsp" target=_blank><IMG src="news/20041106_1.bmp" align=right></A>According to Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com, the EX Team Rocket Returns expansion will be released on Monday, and there is some more info on the site. It will have more than 100 new cards, new Pok&eacute;mon-EX, new Trainer cards, and a new level of rare card (Pok&eacute;mon "star"). Dark and Rocket's Pok&eacute;mon will also reappear in this set. The Pok&eacute;mon "star" have a new foil treatment and artwork, and introduce some new abilities to the game, but it sounds like they'll be comparable in rarity to the "Shining" Pok&eacute;mon from Neo Destiny.<br><br>Starting Monday, booster packs containing 1 reverse holofoil, 1 rare, 2 uncommon, and 5 common cards will sell for MSRP $3.29; and 60-card theme decks including an updated rulebook, Team Rocket-themed game coin, half-playmat, one holofoil card, and a card checklist will sell for MSRP $10.99.<br><br>Speaking of Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com, their PDF-format checklists haven't been working lately, so I'll have to work with the limited information available from the paper checklist from my brother's Team Aqua deck. (^^;) In any case, I will start putting up (partially or incomplete) card set lists next week.<br><br>Article from <A href="http://pokemon-tcg.com/p_news/archives/news_424.jsp" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A>.``xEpAAZAAyZFEFZvfoIt``x1099774473``x(default)
More coming soon``x_JB_``xI haven't been able to update lately; busy with school and homework, and I'm not even at home this weekend, but as soon as I can I'll start putting up card set lists and begin putting things together. I'll also try to complete the anime episode list and begin putting up more reviews, plus make the Duel Masters menu and images and start putting up TCG set lists. This week's CotW will go up on Tuesday, and next week's will be on Friday, as scheduled.``xEpAAZEpuuENgbDgcUN``x1099685241``x(default)
Update, or lack thereof``x_JB_``xYeah, there's really not very much going on right now. I haven't been able to find any new news, except for that EX Team Rocket Returns will have over 100 new cards and will reintroduce Dark Pok&eacute;mon (from <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/" target=_blank>Pok&eacute;mon-TCG.com</A>). The Pok&eacute;mon TCG site also has a <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_cards/cardSearch.jsp" target=_blank>card database search engine</A>, which this site will eventually have. Starting today or tomorrow I'm going to be working on getting TCG set lists put up, for this and for Duel Masters (it's about time I did something for the to-be other half of this site).``xEpAAFAlyVAMArlaupH``x1099373459``x(default)
Tweakage``x_JB_``xToo lazy for a real update today, I'll have something tomorrow. Spent some time this weekend tweaking the news page layout and setting up automatic archiving.

CotW Week 2, Deoxys at Pok&eacute;mon Center NYC, and TCG news``x_JB_``xThat's right, the second Card of the Week is up today, and this time it's Team Aqua's Walrein from the EX Team Aqua vs. Team Magma set. (This has got to be one of my favorite cards ever made. Read the review for more.) The Team Aqua deck will also come under the microscope sometime next week in the Deck Garage, so watch for that.<br><br>The Pok&eacute;mon Center NYC is having a Halloween party this Saturday. There will be Pok&eacute;mon costume contests, music &amp; games, and Pok&eacute;mon Mini tournaments. Also, trainers with FireRed or LeafGreen can get the Aurora Ticket from this event, which is needed to catch Deoxys. (See the Pok&eacute;mon Rocks America 2004 article below.)<br><br>In the TCG world, two new products are available: the <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_news/archives/news_413.jsp" target=_blank>EX Battle Stadium</A> pack, which has 2 60-card theme decks, 4 10-card sideboard packs, a full-size playmat, and more; and <A href="http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_news/archives/news_416.jsp" target=_blank>EX Deck Tins</A>, which come in 4 designs and include 2 EX series booster packs, a holofoil card, and a Pok&eacute;mon sticker pack.

As usual, there were attractions such as costumed characters, TCG and video game booths, tournaments, and carnival games; new with the 2004 tour was the Union Room, where attendees with Pok&eacute;mon FireRed or LeafGreen could battle and trade wirelessly via the adapter included with the game. On the original article page (linked below), there are Flash applets with photo slideshows and videos from the event.

Episode reviews, batch 1``x_JB_``xI adapted all of the episode reviews that I'd had on jps&sup3; into a format that could be used with this site, saved them as text files, and uploaded them, plus the season reviews that I'd written. Thus, there is now something to look at in the episode reviews section. I also changed and reuploaded the About jps4 page. (If you'll notice on the right menu bar, I've also added the part where you can see which pages were changed or added with the most recent update.) Tomorrow I'm going to try to have the Credits/Legal page ready to upload, along with possibly another episode review.``xEpAlEpyylVwEWBvvao``x1098081485``x(default)
Forums...kind of.``x_JB_``xI've uploaded phpBB 2.1.2 as the forums; however, it's only a beta version of version 2.2 (which will be out later this year), so it doesn't work very well. So far, I've verified that the avatar upload feature doesn't work, and can't post announcements and have been having problems with some things on the admin control panel, so there won't be much happening on the forums yet.<br><br>In other news, the first major part of the site that I'm going to work on will be the anime episode reviews. Hopefully I'll be able to put at least a few of those up during the week.``xEpAlpyEVukJtTveFbP``x1098036342``x(default)
Pardon our dust``x_JB_``xYes, we're up. Granted, we only have five or so pages (not that I'm counting), but other than that the site is up and operating as normally as possible. Right now all that works is the Red/Blue walkthrough, the fanfics section, and the "About" page (which'll be changed soon), but I'm making good progress on finishing other sections of the site, and as soon as I'm finished with a page I'll put it up. (The DuelMasters menu doesn't work either; that's next on my list.)``xEpAZVAykEFDfypwWzy``x1097571013``x(default)
