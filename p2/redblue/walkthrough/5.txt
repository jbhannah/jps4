Once you've reached Viridian City, go to the Pok&eacute;mon Center and heal up, then stay where you are (the nurse won't mind), open the menu, and select "Pok&eacute;dex" to bring up your Pok&eacute;dex. What you see is a menu of all of the Pok&eacute;mon you've seen (up to the highest-numbered one you've seen), with any slots for ones you haven't seen marked by a row of dashes. In the top right corner is counts of how many Pok&eacute;mon you've seen and how many of those you've captured, and below that is a submenu: "Data", which shows a picture, and the height, weight, and description of that Pok&eacute;mon; "Cry", which plays the Pok&eacute;mon's game sound (what you hear when it enters battle); "Area", the places on the Town Map where that Pok&eacute;mon can be found; and "Exit". For right now, go ahead and exit.

Next, go to the Pok&eacute;mon Mart and talk to the cashier. Now that you've delivered Oak's Parcel, you can purchase normally from the Pok&eacute;mon Mart. The money you have is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen. When you first talk to the cashier, you're given the options to buy, sell, or quit. Right now, go to "Buy" and select Pok&eacute; Ball (&yen;200). A menu now comes up asking how many you want; use up and down on the d-pad to adjust this number (get 5 for now) and press "A". The cashier tells you the total price, and asks you if you're sure; select "Yes" to confirm the purchase. If you want, you can also get some Poison-curing Antidotes (&yen;100), Paralysis-healing Paralyz Heal (&yen;200), or Burn-treating Burn Heal (&yen;250). When you're done, exit, and leave the Mart, heading west to Route 22.

The grass patch just inside Route 22 is a good place to start catching Pok&eacute;mon. You'll find a lot of Spearow, Rattata, and Nidoran here, and some Mankey if you're playing Pok&eacute;mon Red (if you are, and started with Charmander, capture a Mankey here and train it up well before you reach Pewter City. I'll explain why later). Wander around in this patch for a while, and once you encounter a wild Pok&eacute;mon you'd like to catch, work its HP down to just a few pixels, then go to "Item" and select "Pok&eacute; Ball" to throw a Pok&eacute; Ball at the Pok&eacute;mon. If you're lucky, you'll capture it. Some things that make a wild Pok&eacute;mon easier to catch are Paralyzing it, putting it to Sleep, using Poison, Burn, or an attack like Leech Seed that drops its attack slightly each turn, or lowering its Defense with Tail Whip or Screech. Sometimes, however, even if the wild Pok&eacute;mon only has one pixel of HP left, it'll break free, and you've lost that Pok&eacute; Ball. You can either give up or try again. With some stronger Pok&eacute;mon, you may go through quite a few Pok&eacute; Balls before you can catch it, so don't be too disappointed if you fail at a capture every once in a while. When you do catch a Pok&eacute;mon, its detailed information (height, weight, and description) are added to your Pok&eacute;dex. You are then asked if you want to give your new Pok&eacute;mon a nickname; this works the same as with when you chose your first Pok&eacute;mon, and is optional.

It's usually a good idea to visit the nearest Pok&eacute;mon Center as soon as possible after catching a Pok&eacute;mon. Once you've had your fill of captures for this area, go back to Viridian and heal up at the Pok&eacute;mon Center, then come back and train up a bit on this grass patch. A good way to raise all of your Pok&eacute;mon evenly is to order them from lowest level to highest, and readjusting them when the top Pok&eacute;mon reaches the next level. To sort your Pok&eacute;mon, go to the menu and select Pok&eacute;mon, choose the Pok&eacute;mon you want to move, and select "Switch". Then, choose the Pok&eacute;mon you want the selected one to SWITCH POSITIONS with and press "A". The Pok&eacute;mon at the top of the list is the first one to come out when you begin a battle, and during a battle you can change Pok&eacute;mon by selecting "PKMN" from the battle menu and choosing a Pok&eacute;mon to replace your current active Pok&eacute;mon; doing this on your first turn is a good way to give experience to a Pok&eacute;mon who is far overmatched or too injured (low HP or PP) to battle. There's no limit to the number of times you can switch during a battle, but switching Pok&eacute;mon uses up your turn, so as soon as you've switched the other Pok&eacute;mon attacks. Should one of your Pok&eacute;mon faint, you're asked if you want to use your next Pok&eacute;mon; if all of your Pok&eacute;mon faint, you black out, return to the last Pok&eacute;mon Center you used, and lose half of your money. Train until your first Pok&eacute;mon is level 8 or 9, and your captured Pok&eacute;mon are up to level 5 or 6, then go north from the patch and begin to head west.

Before you can go very far west, though, you stop, and your rival appears from the left side of the screen. He stops in front of you and tells you that the guard at the Pok&eacute;mon League building ahead won't let you through if you don't have any Badges. He then asks if you Pok&eacute;mon has gotten any stronger, and your second rival battle begins. Your rival has a level 9 Pidgey and a level 8 of whatever he started with. If you have your Pok&eacute;mon leveled up to what I suggested in the previous paragraph or higher, you should have any problems with just going all-out against him. He gives you &yen;280 if you beat him.
